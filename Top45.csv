Firstly these are similes not metaphors. Now to my justification Some students are more malleable than others and are more easily influenced by the ideas of professors. Conversely a student may be repulsed if a particular professors beliefs are out of line with the students. The teachers ability to sculpt rather than support a students progress depends on many things personality teaching style and the receptiveness of the student.,A teacher can nurture and help a students ideas flourish and grow. Much like a gardener a teacher can plant seeds of knowledge metaphor and see them through to fruition. This sounds about right to me.,This is one I can definitely wrap my mind around the teacher is like the coach of the classroom of students and all of them together can be seen as a team trying to reach a common goal.,What? I think of an app as something of an addon which can be used at times when needed. This is not my ideal concept of a good teacher. Jeez...if my professors had been like apps I could just have stayed home and surfed the web. There would be no interaction.,This would be the best one so far that I have read here. The tour guide is the brains of the operation and is teaching and showing the tourists about everything. The guide is literally guiding them through the area or whatever it is they are touring and knows what direction to lead them in and how to get there. The college teacher does the same for the students.,This metaphor isnt totally true as there is not growth or learning aspect to it. Sailors are more just hired hands to a captain.,My favorite professors planted ideas and nurtured and fed the students until they flourished and produced their own fruitful ideas.
This one is weird sounding. I suppose because the clay is inanimate and doesnt really have an action itself. You hear people say all the time that the teacher is molding the students but I dont personally like this metaphor. The sculptor is not teaching the clay anything and is not taking care of or nourishing the clay really.,This is a good metaphor. Students will all grow. By definition learning is growth. Some will learn an enormous amount while others not so much.  With good nurturing by the teacher the student will grow stronger faster and healthier.,Coaches are there to encourage players but also help them make the best decisions and are there for tough love when its needed. Too many college students think they can simply make up grades with extra credit and that shouldnt be the case. Just like an athlete is to blame if they perform poorly on the field a student is to blame if their grades arent up to expectations.,This sounds a bit complicated but it makes sense if you really think about it as each teacher has their own information to impart like a specific app and the students access the information.,Teacher tell us how to survive in the outside world and also give some tips and guts and they encourage us to pick out our talents and also they boost up in order that you can be able to do this I will be there for your support.,This metaphor would work if you think of a room like a ship and the journey one of subject knowledge. The teacher is the leader which guides the year and the students learn from this leader.,It describes best what the teacher is and what the students are. The best teachers guided students through their class and if necessary gave them orders and discipline but did not do their work for them.
Again I can agree with this metaphor. The sculptor will guide the clay along the wheel much as it is the responsibility of the teacher to guide their students on the wheel of learning. What begins as a crude interest can be molded and shaped into an accomplished polished mastery of the material.,You cannot weed students out because they are disruptive or failing. Nor can you nurture them like a plant. You have to give them the tools they need and let them grow on their own.,Teachers are supposed to guide students to reach their full potential. They should give students exercises and a structured environment to grow.,I disagree with this because I dont think that it makes sense. This is because the thing thats controlling the app is the operating system of the software. I think a much better metaphor is that the teacher is the operating system and the students are the app. The classroom can even be the smartphone.,This analogy is okay. The students are given a new world to explore and the tools to explore it. Meanwhile the teacher has the means to direct them so that they see all the important sites and no one gets lost. Theres no real incentive for the teacher to perform well here though. Theyre not new to this area. Theyve seen it before and like real life tour guides they might have some days where they just dont care if the tourists are impressed.,The teacher is like a captain guiding the students and driving their ship and the students are like the sailors navigating the educational waters with the teacher as their guide.,The plants have to find their own way to grow up towards the sun and receive nourishment but the teacher can help along the way by providing extra resources or insight in order to facilitate that growth. That seems like a good way of thinking about the classroom experience.
I think that the teacher is the one with the knowledge in a classroom. The student is going to this class to learn what the teacher already knows. The teacher has to decide how to present this knowledge to the students. they have the knowledge and are giving it away to the students. How they choose to give this knowledge away is how they are molding the students like clay. They are providing the knowledge they already know and they are making the students smarter and getting them one step closer to where they want to be.,Every time the teacher teaches a child they become a plant in their garden of affect.,A teacher is definitely like a coach. They are supporting teaching helping and coaching us to learn and grown as people. We are growing our minds!,I somewhat agree with this because if the college student is a smart phone user theyre looking for information. The best resource to get information would be through the app store. The professor will be able to provide them with information theyre searching for.,The teacher shows the student the way and how to navigate the educational process of learning a skill. The teacher guides them through the path of learning.,The captain is responsible for his ship class and that ship isnt going anywhere if you havent educated your sailors. A teacher should be leading that class. He or she should be guiding students by making sure they are covering the assigned material in class giving an opportunity to ask questions and helping find the answers. It is a journey that the teacher and students are both embarking on. By giving your students the tools they need to succeed and leading them you will help them reach beyond their goals.,My teachers were much like captains. They oversaw their classrooms and commanded respect. You did not goof off in those classes. It was their job to educate you on the material and get you to your destination which was a passing grade for that class. If you followed the command of your leader you would arrive at that destination.
This analogy sort of fits a sculptor takes something thats why I turn it into something refined. Its kind of the same thing with the college teacher they have these kids with blank slates and they tried to fill them with knowledge.,This is more of something I agree with because there is some chance that a plant will not develop. Like a student that may fail a class even with correct watering.,The coach expects his athletes to work hard and perform well when it counts. Its a constant checkingup system.,I can agree with this one the teacher is an app store with all the information and the knowledge. The students then based on their own focus and desire to engage will opt in or not. Some students users will make sure to get the most of the experience and pay extra to get more out of the experience.,This is getting a little closer to something I would agree strongly with. I like the idea of this being a journey of sorts with the teacher being the learned one who knows the terrain and the students coming along for the trip. Theres no requirement for the students to be passive here but they can be if they choose to be. And the teacher knows not only where theyre going but how theyll get there and the details along the way.,I like this analogy because it implies that the ship wont go anywhere if the students are not in sync with the teacher. The teacher knows how to sail the boat but to get moving he must teach the students what he knows. A classroom too is a structure without purpose if the students arent able to haul up the anchor as it were.,It just sounds the most fitting. As a student you are fresh and growing and learning. If there teacher does his job right the student will blossom into a full grown flower AKA someone who is mature educated and ready.
Students are there to absorb information taught to them by the professor so I think comparing them to an artist and a work of art is a fair comparison. Just like the artist wont be successful if their work is garbage a professor should be judged on the success of his or her students. The students need the teacher to teach them in order to grow and mature. Sometimes a great teacher can change a students life and or or career path.,The teacher plants the seed into the student and the student grows from there. The teacher continues to mend the garden and the students learn and grow from what they are taught and instructed.,Somewhat agree in the sense that a coach provides the plan of attack and helps athletes focus on their strengths and discard bad habits in pursuit of their goal.,A teacher is like an app to share their talent and good things to their student and student is like the user to understanding their concept.,I think this metaphor is alright but not great. Not even good. It implies that students are only popping in for a quick visit to knowledge or learning before they head back home to ignorant bliss. And teachers are much more than tour guides. Tour guides show tourists the highlights only they dont get into the nitty gritty details the rich culture behind the village on the side of the mountain overlooking the bay. They just say And here we have Peaceful Village 274.,The teacher is the overseer of the vessel that is education. The students are workers that help keep the ship going and they defer to the captain for help in their educational journey.,It represents the good professors Ive had so far in my college education. A good professor nurtures a student and helps him or her succeed without coddling it or simply letting it slide by. I think the imagery of a plant represents a students growth well and shows that the gardener simply cant grow something without the plant and the plant cant grow without the gardener. Its a partnership that represents success for both parties.
Students have open minds and are ready to absorb the knowledge given to them so I definitely agree. Clay is nothing without a sculptor students cannot absorb knowledge without a guide.,This makes sense because the teachers are providing knowledge which is like water and the students are supposed to absorb it.,I think this is true. A coach teaches encourages and supports athletes as they progress and work to achieve their goals. Teachers do the same thing for students and it is an ongoing collaborative relationship that results in achievement if done properly or lack of success if no work and effort are put into it.,Students as users have access to teachers. As a store the teachers have a plethora of apps or advice or knowledge which students can use. However teachers arent controlled by students like app stores are controlled by users.,This idea is more in line with what I believe. A teacher can expose a student to many landscapes of thought and the student is invited to participate.,This is a great metaphor for the studentteacher relationships because a ships captain is responsible for steering the ship and the safety of all the passengers much like the teacher is responsible for steering all the students in the right direction. ,I think that teachers are there to help students learn and grow. When you are done with a class you will always know something more than you knew before and so your knowledge grows like a plant.
The teacher molds students and shows them new shapes. Students are raw materials to be shaped and guided.,A teacher is like the gardener who plants the educational seeds into the students as flowers would in a garden and helps them to grow to their full potential as learners.,The coach guides the general direction of the team but in a classroom theres no single real world objective like there is on a team. Hopefully the teacher or coach will impart some knowledge on the students or athletes along the way.,Yes the app store has all the apps and the teacher has all the knowledge. It is up for the student to download that knowledge.,I think that a professor is more than a tour guide. They do indeed have the knowledge but do not just spit out stuff and students listen. They have a deeper understanding of the content.,I like this metaphor a lot. The teacher is at the helm steering the ship to whatever port of call will be the most instructive. Maybe were learning about American agriculture today so off the boat goes to the port of Des Moines to learn about corn wheat and soy. Were the students shanghaied? Maybe a bit. But for the most part they signed on for this voyage.,I feel that a teacher is part of the whole process and not just the leader as like in a garden. We are growing and learning because of the teachers guidance knowledge and support. The teacher was one of us before and now they are helping our minds grow into our own flowers.
Before we entered the class we didnt know anything about the subject. We were just an unfinished block of clay. As we learned we were able to carve out pieces of the block and reveal what is hidden in it. At the end of the class it actually looks like something and has been formed.,I can see how this could be used as a metaphor although I like the ship captain one better. The teacher can most definitely be compared to a gardener as it is his or her responsibility to plant that seed of learning bring the material to life and nourish that curiosity into a sturdy mastery of the material.,While there is definitely a little bit of truth here since teachers and coaches arent completely dissimilar I dont agree with the notion that the class is necessarily like a team. Not everyone works together necessarily. Classes are more loose than that and students arent necessarily working towards a shared goal. True the goal is the same but that doesnt mean its a shared goal. Students are competing against one another largely and even the teacher may be seen as an antagonist.,In many ways a student can hold the key to knowledge in their hands so to speak. If the teacher is the app then it is up to the student to access the knowledge from the teacher in order to empower the student.,The teach is bringing them on a journey but I think I only somewhat agree because a tour guide is providing a more passive experience whereas a teacher is usually there to get the subject the knowledge embedded and deeply understood.,This puts the professor fully in charge of the game with no input from students except for doing grunt work. I dont like that simile at all. There should be more interaction between parties.,This is the closest. It still lacks nuance. A teacher imparts wisdom and pushes students towards a goal. However a teacher in the humanities me gives the student the tools necessary to run their own race in their own way.
This analogy is okay. It places the responsibility for creating a beautiful work entirely in the teachers hands which Im not fond of. On the one hand it encourages the teacher to really look at their class like a passion project. On the other hand though the students are left with the options of being cooperative clay or not I guess?,I agree since the professors are the ones who sow information so that they flower professionals.,This metaphor makes sense because like a coach with athletes working toward winning games a teacher rallies their students to work toward goals such as exams and projects.,The teacher is the store that all the users go to to get information and assignments. The students also have to pay the app store for its time.,The teacher guides the students in their educational journeys and the students are like the tourists on the tour and looking forward for their education and in their studies to learn more.,It is a great metaphor. Teachers lead a ship with many students and sailors.,As I said in the explanation before I think this analogy works best because it puts teacher and student in the same boat. I mean theyre literally in a boat and they have a clear objective which is to figure out how to and then sail the thing so they get to wherever theyd like to head.
A scultor sculpts the clay into a finished product. A teacher also modifies what the students know into something that is a finished product,This is a good metaphor. It implies that the teacher is planting seeds of knowledge in his students and can nurture and watch them grow.,This simile in more appropriate because a coachs job is to teach a skill and students if they are like athletes practice the skill in this case learning about a subject. After all is done the student will have acquired a new skill or set of ideas.,I somewhat agree with this. We as students are the smartphones users. We know the phone has many apps that can give us knowledge and provide us with information that we do not know just like a teacher. As a student we have the control on if we decide to use the apps provided to us. The teacher has the information like the app and we have to smartphone which if the ability to open that app and listen and gain more knowledge.,A teacher is supposed to teach us about the unknown. We are tourists in an unfamiliar location and they are the guides with adequate knowledge about our surroundings.,Teacher is like a captain of ship the student is like a sailor to handle the problems.,Like I wrote before its the metaphor that I feel best reflects reality. A teacher in a single semester cannot do much more than show the sights to his or her students just like a tour guide in an exotic city. Hopefully however the students decide to dig deeper on their own because they have been inspired to learn more. A great teacher and a great tour guide both provide this inspiration. I had a teacher just like this in my Intro to Business Law elective class who could truly only give the absolute bare bones of the subject in our 2 hours together each week but he showed me how fascinating the law is. While I didnt go on to study the law nor do I intend to I love reading Nolo guides.
I agree partly with this. Students have much more influence on their own molding than the quote implies. However in general the educating and shaping of the students is in the hands of the professor. The students definitely have a degree of helplessness and impotence. Without the professors guidance and expertise there is only so much the students can do.,I do believe teachers are like gardeners. They chose how to mold the information in the student just as a gardener choses how to help the plant grow. They can use a certain fertilizer make sure it is watered at certain times. The teacher is able to grow the student and help them become stronger and smarter on the particular subject.,This one works very very well. The coach is guiding and teaching the athletes and has the same goal as the athletes. The coach is a mentor to them and they all work together toward the same goal.,This makes sense because the teacher is providing students with a service with information. They offer many things to students and its up to students what they take in and decide to remember and learn from.,In a sense the teacher is the tour guide guiding students through a topic that is hopefully new to them just like a tour guide would guide tourists through a new city. If the tour guide is crap the tourists lose out on information they may be interested in.,I agree with the metaphor. But I see the captain as teaching the students how to be the captain. Do students just follow orders?,I prefer this metaphor because it shows that students are most likely going to grow but with careful and consistent attention from their gardener teachers they can grow even more than before. It helps me envision teachers as doing everything they can to provide an environment for success for their growing students.
This is not as good because clay assumes the role of the molded. The sculptor can guide but there is a difference between sculpting your own image and guidance. Ideally you would guide them to build their own. This analogy turns it around slightly and dilutes the meaning.,A teacher provides the resources and information for students to grow as educators. Especially at the entry level college classes are more than just absorbing information and vomiting it back to the professor in paper or exam form. The best teachers help students become successful learners and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed rather than simply feeding them the answers.,I like this line of thought the professors give us the chance to become great athletes so to speak we work hard and carve our own path with their advice and guidance.,This implies a consumerbusiness transaction and also supposes the teacher as the hub for all information and access.,Like a tour guide the teacher present students with interesting and different aspects and notions on the students journey to being a wellrounded person.,The students are not there to help run the ship they are there to gain knowledge so this comparison I do not feel is as good as some of the others. Sailors assist the captain with a lot of the ship work.,I like it because I believe the teacher is an overseer who guides the student in education. They help them develop the tools they need in mastering the educational system. This metaphor was seen several times in my past college career. A teacher helped me learn new skills to become a productive member of the work force and life.
And here we are back in the kinda sorta maybe category. I heard once that Michelangelo said that his job wasnt to carve the statue from the stone it was to simply remove all the bits that werent the statue. That the statue was already inside. I have a friend who works in clay. When shes throwing clay it almost feels like a battle to get the clay to go where she wants it to go. So that part could be accurate. I think a more accurate metaphor in this vein would be that the students were apprentices to the master sculptor their teacher and the teacher was merely teaching them how to cut away the bits of themselves that werent their true self.,Plants serve a purpose and a gardner tends and monitors the plants to make them grow. Teacher need to make students useful and tend to them and let them grow,I also agree with this metaphor as the teacher much like a coach provides a game plan for success. They are guides for the students minds instead of their bodies.,I agree with the metaphor. Teachers are like the app store meaning that they provide students with an opportunity to grow and become more than what they are. They supply the environment for which you learn and determine how much you will actually learn in school.,It seemed a bit glib at first but the more I thought about it the more I realized that in one class or semester a teacher really cant do more than show you the sights.  Its up to the students to decide how closely they want to look and if they want to go deeper.,You have to follow the orders of your professor or captain or else you will suffer the consequences. In the classroom this translates to poor grades.,I prefer this metaphor the best because it shows how something can start small and a teacher helps them bloom and grow to be their best self.
This metaphor makes total sense as teachers shape their students and mold them into better people.,This is just like the clay analogy. The teacher is in control here. They have all of the power. They decide whether or not the garden is beautiful or not. They do have a vested interest in helping the students grow but the students have no say in the matter. The just respond to stimuli,A teacher could be like a coach. A coach and teacher are one and the same both pushing their students to achieve the highest performance possible and teaching them that if they work hard enough they will not only accomplish their goals but surpass them.,I think of the app store being the college itself. The college is the instrument that delivers the knowledge or app to the student.,Allan Bloom uses this metaphor in his classic The Closing of the American Mind. One of his students called him the worlds greatest tour guide. In his view the role of the teacher is to guide the student through history to expose the student to new ways that are not easily viewable by oneself. He uses Platos analogy of the cave as an example.,The teacher definitely is the leader in the classroom and the students follow him or her on a journey. But a captain is supposed to have his sailors best interest at heart. Sometimes teachers dont.,The teacher provides for the plant and the plant takes in what it is given and uses it to build itself up. It is a two party system in which each fulfills a role but the majority of the actual work is performed by the student but in the proper environment.
Id rather teachers be compared to gardeners or guides rather than sculptors. The verb mold makes me feel as if teachers are forcing their views onto the students which we may sometimes do rather than leading them through to the different answers. This rubbed me the wrong way.,The professor helps them grow to become successful. The professor has plenty of resources needed to help students. If students are like the plants than they can live off of the professor to get what they need and to grow.,This applies for the most part. An athlete grows under the direction of a good coach just as students grow from the knowledge and nurturing received from their teacher.,The app store contains all of the data. A teacher also contains all of the data. The phone and the students are then those that consume said data.,Tour guides show points of interests just skimming the surface of area.,This could work. Like the teachers are in charge of the ship they are charting the course of the education but students have to do the hard work to make the course happen.,I like the analogy of you start with a seed as a gardener and slowly watch it grow into something. Where as with a student you have a new one every semester to plant that seed and watch it grow.
The teacher uses his or her experiences and knowledge to help shape the students minds to get them to better grasp what they are being taught.,Somewhat agree in the sense that a good teacher can plant the seeds of new ideas in a new student and help weed out the bad ideas that might hold them back.,This is probably the most direct metaphor. A teacher coaches students and directs them what they need to do. They dont always follow exactly what they say because they have a mind of their own and control what they think.,I think this is very simplified. Teachers can be conduits for learning but you have to pay attention. You have to ask intelligent questions and you have to be present. A professor isnt really like something you can carry around in your pocket but he or she is available.,,I agree because teachers do guide the course for students. They lead the way but the students must steer.,I think this is most illustrative of the relationship between teachers and students. Teachers are the experts. They know where the class is going how theyre going to get there and the details along the way. The students are guided there by the teacher but they dont have to be passive can ask questions etc and they dont even have to pay attention if they dont want. The teacher would like them to follow and like them to pay attention but thats up to the students. The teacher is just a guide not a taskmaster or a teammate. It is ultimately the students responsibility to get things out of the tour. Also I dont think classmates are necessarily buddies or on the same team or anything like that. Theyre individuals who may or may not band together but they arent inherently interested in a shared goal with each other or even with the teacher. So the tour guide metaphor works there too.
Of course teachers are sculptor and students are clay because they provide a shape and help us to be in great position so teachers are considered as sculptors.,This metaphor makes the teacher seems like someone who is invested in their students and wants them to reach their full potential with careful and consistent attention. The teachers will one day reap what they sow in seeing their students become successful in their field of study.,A professor is a leader for knowledge. Coaches are usually more demanding and expecting of performance that professors generally are. Some students can be like athletes in terms of them competing for the best grades in the class.,I really do not understand or relate to that analogy. I guess the teacher can be considered as having all the tools that a student needs to succeed and the students just need to pick and use the tools.,,When the teacher is perfect only we can able to learn so many things and also he guides us to do so many things they were like a pathway in our life to teach us so many new things.,This one was my favourite metaphor because to me it explains so well the bond as well the relationship which students and teachers share. Students need the guidance of teachers like sailors need to be guided by their captain as he or she steers them forward onto the right course which could also be symbolic of their path or destiny. I have certainly felt similarly with my own experiences of the teaching that I have received in college.
Eh. I guess that this one is a little ok. But you cant shape people that much its more like the people are almost like wood. Sure you can try to do a bit but its not going to change much.,The teacher spends time tending to their students just like a gardener does and doing things to nurture them and help them grow like water them give them food make sure they have good conditions to thrive.  If they do this they will grow and thrive. If they neglect the students they will wilt and not learn.,Its not the most imaginative metaphor but its apt. The teacher has gone beyond the stage in his or her life when she would be an athlete or student and is now passing on his or her wisdom and guidance to the next generation.,I can see this being true. Students are able to go to the store and get what they need and use it to their benefit. Same thing with a teacher and a class. This puts power in the hands of the students to pick and choose what they want to learn from the teacher just like they pick and choose at an app store.,,I actually disagree with this one. I stated earlier that to me when you reach college you are more on an equal playing ground. Maybe it is because I was older when I chose to attend college but I did not feel as if they were in charge. I felt that even though they had knowledge on the subject there was never a relationship that they were above me as the leader and I was the follower like a captain and sailors.,First off Im enjoying the mental picture of some of my college professors as pirates shivering their timbers with eye patches and parrots on their shoulders. I think this metaphor is the most apt because the teacher sets the course its syllabus and exactly what will be taught just as a ship captain sets the course makes daily decisions to detour here or there and guides the shipboard operations all the while. Students pile in to a lecture hall or the cargo hold of the boat get their marching orders or syllabus and off they go to the port of Des Moines.
It occurs to me that the role of the teacher is not to mold the student so much as that would be more like what a mentor would do. A teacher is a bit more handsoff than that.,I could see this being apt if the students are getting a lot from the experience and growing like a plant. But this metaphor places more of the responsibility on the teacher and in real life it is the students who have to mature or wither not the gardener.,The teacher assigns the work that he believes will teach the course. It is up to the student to pass. An athlete does not need to pass he does it because he wants to be competitive. Student passes to get the degree.,The students should not pick and choose what they want to learn. Theyre paying to be there for a reason. Theres a vast breadth of knowledge in both the app store and the teacher but the students should try to absorb a lot more of it percentage wise from a teacher than they do an app store.,,Calling the teacher the captain and students the sailors makes it seem more like the professor is in charge and the students are simply yes men or women who are to follow the professors every command. I dont think a good classroom environment works like this.,They plant the seeds of knowledge tend to the growth of that knowledge and finally fine prune that knowledge guiding it 
Minds are empty of the subject matter and ready to be shaped.,The teacher is watering the students with knowledge and feeding them nutrients so that they can grow big and strong.,Again this is a simile not a metaphor. A teacher much like a coach is an encourager a guide on the side a person in charge a leader. Students are like athletes in that they listen and respond to the coach and they work hard.,The users use and store all the content that the app in this case the teacher provides.,,Teachers should steer students minds in the direction of passion and curiosity.,Plants grow and so do students. I like the idea that teachers help students grow into their full potential.
The teacher sculpts the students and helps them in their educational journeys and to be successful in their studies as a sculptor sculpts clay into something better and more interesting than a block of clay.,I could see what they mean. The gardener works to care for and tend to the plants. If they dont take careful action the plants could wither away to nothing. They could also grow out of control. A gardener would provide what they need to grow properly.,Very much. Coaches are teachers and they have a lot of authority. Students must do what the teacher says and not everyone makes the cut. Students like athletes are judged by performance.,Absolutely not. You dont get to walk into a classroom and tell your teacher Ok were going to talk about the history of the Cheerio today. Heres $1.99. The teacher sets the syllabus chooses the subject matter makes the choices drives the train steers the ship leads the tour decides the things. The students far in advance choose the courses maybe with a little knowledge of the instructor maybe without. Its the course they want not the teacher.,,The teacher steers the ship. The students are mere workers and follow orders. That is all I believe.,Coaches are a type of teacher they offer advice they guide they instruct they encourage.  Students are academic athletes who must learn from their teachers but when they are out in the field taking a test or working a job they must rely on what they learned from their coach.  They are on their own.
Students are impressionable and need to be guided into shape. Teachers play a significant hand in molding the students into responsible intelligent adults.,This metaphor makes sense since gardeners cultivate plants like teachers have to cultivate students to foster a positive learning experience and environment.,Teachers are going out their way to try and teach people things they need to be able to grow into being adults and go down the path they choose.,,,Captain of the ship is the person in charge and sets direction and people must follow and not veer off course. If a teacher does this it does not expand thinking of the students.,Because students are the nucleus of the future the mainstay of the country. Should be cared for and trained so this statement is very true for the job of university lecturers.
I dont see teachers as shaping the students into what they want but its more of a giving of knowledge arrangement and the students can make of the information what they will rather than just becoming a product of what the teacher says.,This metaphor is more appropriate than the last one. Teachers do tend to their students nurturing them and helping them grow. They can even be the people who remove obstacles i.e. weeds from the students growth. The problem is that the teacher didnt plant the students. Their parents did. their parents instilled a basic love for learning or for subject matter so the students would want to grow in that area.,A college teacher is like a coach they guide students to success. They are unlike a coach in that they show more compassion and do not bench people for poor performance.,,,The captain of a ship is like the guide that the sailors follow. The teacher is also a guide that the students follow on their academic journey.,Because gardeners nurture plants to survive and grow as do teachers. My teachers nurtured our minds helped us along to understand the material.
I wouldnt say clay. I would say students are like wood. They are rough and unformed but are solid. They have strong but undefined form.,This is another good one. Just like the gardener is caring for and feeding and watching over his plants the college teacher is doing the same for his students.,A teacher is like a coach and students are like athletes because the teacher is pushing the students to new heights by teaching them.,,,I dont see this one applying too much most teachers in college are not leaders unless theyre deans or heads of some organization. So I dont strongly disagree  but most teachers arent looking to navigate their own ship with the students as crew. Maybe time to time in certain settings. In general the teacher is more like a tour boat guide.,I think it fits well with saying that a teacher helps to shape a students mind just as a sculptor shapes the clay. I feel like my college teachers have helped shape me in some ways as how to think about certain subjects or view certain aspects of a subject.
A professor is there to guide them which is sculpting them with the knowledge they need. Students can be soft and easy to work with if theyre given the resources theyre interested in learning with.,Again I think this is somewhat true because a gardner can determine the outcome of his or her plants by taking good care teaching well of the plants or hurting the plants by ignoring them teaching poorly.,Generally speaking coaches are there to plan the route provide guidance and help steer those under their care in the right direction. The students or athletes are responsible for the physical action of making that happen. In other words its on them to put in the effort.,,,This works. Not all the time but works especially for advanced classes. Here the teacher and student are on the same team trying find the truth or reach a destination. This is how seminars are often taught. But introductory classes are different. Students cannot yet help the professor the way a sailor helps the captain.,Once again I think this is most apt because I felt that in the majority of my college courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels the professors were not interested in my thoughts or freedom of thought but wanted to push their political viewpoints down my throat. They wanted to sculpt me in their image.
This is the most imaginative so far. The teacher uses his or her experience and expertise to try to mold the students into a more complete form. However one teacher in one class does not a finished sculpture or student make.,Yes every lecture the teacher is showering the little growing students with knowledge so they can grow as a person.,,,,The teacher is the leader in the classroom. They know how to steer the conversation about facts of the subject. The students or sailors must understand every command to get experience.,its true that teachers show students around and give them a peek at a lot of things.
Students should be a little more than a lump of dirt but it is nice to imagine them as moldable.,A teacher is the person responsible for planting seeds of knowledge into their students. Just like a good gardener the teacher will continue to provide aspects such as encouragement and learning materials to prepare students for a lifetime of learning.,,,,I agree with this metaphor because the sailors follow the lead of the captain. The students agree to study and listen to what the teacher is saying. The teacher is the one who sets the path that the students follow just like a captain of a ship sets the path for the sailors. ,I just like what it says. The teacher plants the seeds and helps the students grow in their college journeys.
The students are not unmolded raw material they are thinking sentient beings. They shouldnt be sculpted rather they should be given the information without any external spin and allowed to make decisions for themselves.,I think it is obvious that this metaphor works. The teacher is growing the students mind by nourishing it with more information and knowledge. That is good information and good knowledge.,,,,Its a little less refined than the coach and athlete analogy but its similar. The captain simply navigates and helps keep things in line as well as provides direction. The sailors are responsible for implementing this as well as taking care of their other responsibilities. Its not quite as good of an analogy though.,Because I believe a sculptor sees the potential in the clay and can see in their mind what they want to create with it. It is not a metaphor where someone is greater than another. This metaphor explains that there is a person that sees the greatness and wants to bring it out. In the metaphor it is the clay and as a teacher it is the student.
Its like a teacher is sculpting the student into a model of something that needs to be made.,I could agree with that. the teacher is feeding their brains but up to them to eat.,,,,,It is the most living and vital of the metaphors. I also like the mental imagery it generates. I am a gardener too so I get it.
The metaphor makes sense since teachers tend to shape students way of thinking and help mold them into slightly different versions of themselves.,I think this is a very accurate description as a teacher must tend the students minds much like plants. The gardener does all they can to guide the plants in the right direction but it is ultimately on them to grow.,,,,,Gardeners supply water and some tender loving care and let nature students take care of the rest.
Teachers dont have that much influence on students. Students dont start out as a blank slate.,The teacher knows how the plants need to grow in order to be strong and fullydeveloped. Students rely on the teacher for information and support just like plants rely on the gardener for care and support.,,,,,After viewing the others I think its the most apt. Ultimately learning is in the hands of the student and cant be forced by the teacher. They can try to help it and they can prune the bits that dont belong but its still up to the student in the end.
A teacher helps us become who we want to be so in a sense we are like clay and the teacher helps us transform into a final product.,A teacher provides mental nourishment to the minds of the students like plants tended by a gardener.,,,,,it comes closest to the idea that the teacher pushes students in the right direction but that the students are ultimately responsible for their own growth. The teacher helps guide their growth much like a gardener tends his plants.
They mold students into their idea of a student but I think most molds are already defined.,I agree with this because it means that teachers plant ideas into their heads and then the students use that information to grow. Whether or not they agree with the info they still have that information in their minds.,,,,,I think it fits best because it puts empowerment into the hands of the students and gives them the responsibility of picking the right tools from the class and teacher and using them to their benefit rather than implying its the teachers responsibility.
,I think this is pretty true because students have the opportunity to grow in a class. A teacher can cultivate them and help them learn and develop into something bigger and stronger.,,,,,I liked this metaphor because it emphasizes the advising and teaching role of the teacher and the individuality of the students. They are not all being molded the same or taking all of the nurturing from the teacher but instead growing and changing in their own ways.
,The teacher tends to the students and helps them grow with daily care. The teacher provides an environment for growth.,,,,,Since I referenced Allan Bloom in my response Ill quote him now One of the most flattering things that ever happened to me as a teacher occurred when I received a postcard from a very good student on his first visit to Italy who wrote You are not a professor of political philosophy but a travel agent. Nothing could have better expressed my intention as an educator. He thought I had prepared him to see. Then he could begin thinking for himself with something to think about. The real sensation of the Florence in which Machiavelli is believable is worth all the formulas of metaphysics ten times over. Education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.
,This is just like the sculptor metaphor. These are getting to be redundant. The teacher waters the students with knowledge and they grow.,,,,,I think it fits because they are steering you to a good future.
,The teacher as the gardener can not mold the students as flowers. The student can choose to learn the material by themselves. A flower can not grow without the nutrients provided by the gardener.,,,,,I prefer this because teachers are showing a new world of knowledge to students. Thus they are like tour guides and must show the sights to students tourists. It makes the most sense in a knowledgelearning way. It makes the most sense because tour guides teach and tourists listen.
,A teacher carefully cultivates the student into becoming a successful person. The teacher gives the student the things the student needs to successfully grown into a productive person just like a gardener cultivates the plant.,,,,,It fits because a lot of my teachers have all had a hand in molding me to be the person I am today. 
,This is a decent metaphor. The teachers impart knowledge that helps the students grow just like a gardener feeds and waters the plants to help them grow.,,,,,I prefer this metaphor because I believe it most accurately captures the essence of the teacher or student relationship. Students have to grow on their own but teachers are there to foster their growth and development.
,College teachers try to cultivate strong thinking skills. The course a student is on is pretty set like a plant but as with gardening a teacher can influence how well a student grows in their thinking.,,,,,I prefer this metaphor because I think it is the most accurate description of teaching. It fits my experiences of what I went through when I was studying in college. Teachers are coaches that push students to improve in certain areas. They direct them on what to study. 
,Teachers help students grow just like plants in a garden start off as a seed and nothing then they grow because they are being taken care of.,,,,,Again college students are not children. By that point in their lives they only need guidance and should be left alone to create their own paths. So in this context that would mean that the teacher simply coaches by giving game plans support and examples while the implementation is up to the students athletes. That is they must put forth the effort to succeed. It cannot be handed to them. Out of all the ones given this is the most accurate representation. 
,Teachers have to water their students with knowledge. They feed knowledge to their students and have to keep their brains fresh and neat.,,,,,
,This seems very similar to the sculptor or clay metaphor and I agree with it to a degree. The growing and learning of the students is largely in the hands of the professor. They are the ones who know where theyre going and how they have to get there. However just like with the previous metaphor this one fails to place onus on the students themselves. Plants do basically nothing but sit there. Students must be far more active in their own educations to learn or accomplish anything regardless of the actions of the teacher.,,,,,
,A teacher is like a gardener and students are like plants because the water is the knowledge that the teacher is giving the students. The more knowledge the more the students have a chance to grow.,,,,,
,A teacher is like a gardener since they are attending to the plants students and giving them nourishment in the form of knowledge.,,,,,
