First, tour guides and tourists have a kind of impersonal relationship.  It is a short but influential relationship. Second, the tour guide has a wealth of information on a particular subject, and the tour guide wants to learn/hear about this information, much like a teacher and student.  Third, a tour guide is a leader of a group and the tourists are the group that follows the tour guide, much like a teacher and student relationship.	2	 	3	1	 	1	6	Secondary Education - English	5	1	I taught English in a public high school for eighteen years.	42	1	5	No	 simile compares two things using ikeor s.A metaphor compares two things without using ikeor s so all of the statements in the survey were similes, not metaphors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
