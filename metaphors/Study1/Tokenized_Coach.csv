A,teacher,can,nurture,and,help,a,students,ideas,flourish,and,grow,.,Much,like,a,gardener,a,teacher,can,plant,seeds,of,knowledge,metaphor,and,see,them,through,to,fruition,.,This,sounds,about,right,to,me,.
Students,arent,plants,they,are,humans,.
The,teacher,tends,to,the,students,and,helps,them,grow,like,a,gardener,in,a,garden,of,plants,.
Teacher,is,like,a,gardener,and,student,is,like,a,plant,to,carry,about,their,health,.
This,is,a,good,metaphor,.,Students,will,all,grow,.,By,definition,learning,is,growth,.,Some,will,learn,an,enormous,amount,while,others,not,so,much,.,With,good,nurturing,by,the,teacher,the,student,will,grow,stronger,faster,and,healthier,.
This,metaphor,would,work,better,for,elementary,school,.,While,college,students,are,still,growing,I,dont,think,of,college,teachers,as,nurturing,as,elementary,school,teachers,are,.

Yes,they,teach,and,nurture,students,minds,.
You,can,not,weed,students,out,because,they,are,disruptive,or,failing,.,Nor,can,you,nurture,them,like,a,plant,.,You,have,to,give,them,the,tools,they,need,and,let,them,grow,on,their,own,.
Every,time,the,teacher,teaches,a,child,they,become,a,plant,in,their,garden,of,affect,.
This,is,another,good,one,.,Just,like,the,gardener,is,caring,for,and,feeding,and,watching,over,his,plants,the,college,teacher,is,doing,the,same,for,his,students,.
This,is,more,of,something,I,agree,with,because,there,is,some,chance,that,a,plant,will,not,develop,.,Like,a,student,that,may,fail,a,class,even,with,correct,watering,.
I,guess,this,one,makes,sense,in,that,that,we,as,students,are,growing,to,become,a,beautiful,smart,intelligent,plant,.,I,like,this,one,.
The,teacher,plants,the,seed,into,the,student,and,the,student,grows,from,there,.,The,teacher,continues,to,mend,the,garden,and,the,students,learn,and,grow,from,what,they,are,taught,and,instructed,.
For,plants,its,necessary,to,have,a,gardener,because,to,take,care,of,its,growth,.,So,teachers,are,considered,as,gardener,.
Again,I,think,this,is,somewhat,true,because,a,gardner,can,determine,the,outcome,of,his,or,her,plants,by,taking,good,care,teaching,well,of,the,plants,or,hurting,the,plants,by,ignoring,them,teaching,poorly,.
Yes,every,lecture,the,teacher,is,showering,the,little,growing,students,with,knowledge,so,they,can,grow,as,a,person,.
This,makes,sense,because,the,teachers,are,providing,knowledge,which,is,like,water,and,the,students,are,supposed,to,absorb,it,.
Sure,I,agree,a,little,with,this,one,.,Its,kind,of,like,the,statue,one,.
A,student,flourishes,with,the,proper,teaching,.
A,teacher,is,the,person,responsible,for,planting,seeds,of,knowledge,into,their,students,.,Just,like,a,good,gardener,the,teacher,will,continue,to,provide,aspects,such,as,encouragement,and,learning,materials,to,prepare,students,for,a,lifetime,of,learning,.
I,think,it,is,obvious,that,this,metaphor,works,.,The,teacher,is,growing,the,students,mind,by,nourishing,it,with,more,information,and,knowledge,.,That,is,good,information,and,good,knowledge,.
This,makes,a,little,bit,more,sense,metaphorically,compared,to,the,other,examples,regarding,technology,or,sports,.,I,can,see,a,natural,growth,analogy,here,.
Yes,there,is,a,lot,of,growth,.
I,could,agree,with,that,.,the,teacher,is,feeding,their,brains,but,up,to,them,to,eat,.
I,think,this,is,a,very,accurate,description,as,a,teacher,must,tend,the,students,minds,much,like,plants,.,The,gardener,does,all,they,can,to,guide,the,plants,in,the,right,direction,but,it,is,ultimately,on,them,to,grow,.
Again,the,students,as,plants,have,to,agree,to,grow,in,order,for,this,to,work,out,.
A,teacher,is,like,the,gardener,who,plants,the,educational,seeds,into,the,students,as,flowers,would,in,a,garden,and,helps,them,to,grow,to,their,full,potential,as,learners,.
I,can,see,how,this,could,be,used,as,a,metaphor,although,I,like,the,ship,captain,one,better,.,The,teacher,can,most,definitely,be,compared,to,a,gardener,as,it,is,his,or,her,responsibility,to,plant,that,seed,of,learning,bring,the,material,to,life,and,nourish,that,curiosity,into,a,sturdy,mastery,of,the,material,.
I,agree,since,the,professors,are,the,ones,who,sow,information,so,that,they,flower,professionals,.
The,teacher,knows,how,the,plants,need,to,grow,in,order,to,be,strong,and,fully,developed,.,Students,rely,on,the,teacher,for,information,and,support,just,like,plants,rely,on,the,gardener,for,care,and,support,.
This,is,a,good,metaphor,.,It,implies,that,the,teacher,is,planting,seeds,of,knowledge,in,his,students,and,can,nurture,and,watch,them,grow,.
Within,a,single,roof,they,will,teach,lesson,for,so,many,students,and,also,they,will,grasp,all,the,students,and,when,there,is,any,mistake,he,will,have,the,talent,to,find,out,easily,.
I,see,how,this,makes,sense,because,a,gardener,takes,care,of,his,plants,to,help,them,grow,into,the,best,of,what,they,can,be,much,like,a,teacher,with,their,students,.
I,think,that,although,the,college,teachers,I,have,had,have,been,very,lazy,in,terms,of,schoolwork,they,do,teach,us,a,lot,about,life,.,They,are,influential,people,that,we,see,on,a,regular,basis,who,have,a,lot,of,insight,into,adult,life,so,to,speak,.
I,do,believe,teachers,are,like,gardeners,.,They,chose,how,to,mold,the,information,in,the,student,just,as,a,gardener,choses,how,to,help,the,plant,grow,.,They,can,use,a,certain,fertilizer,make,sure,it,is,watered,at,certain,times,.,The,teacher,is,able,to,grow,the,student,and,help,them,become,stronger,and,smarter,on,the,particular,subject,.
A,teacher,provides,mental,nourishment,to,the,minds,of,the,students,like,plants,tended,by,a,gardener,.
A,gardener,cares,for,and,helps,his,plants,to,grow,.,A,teacher,does,the,same,thing,with,his,or,her,students,.,They,come,in,with,different,ideas,and,values,and,learn,new,things,and,as,a,consequence,inevitably,grow,.
A,teacher,provides,the,resources,and,information,for,students,to,grow,as,educators,.,Especially,at,the,entry,level,college,classes,are,more,than,just,absorbing,information,and,vomiting,it,back,to,the,professor,in,paper,or,exam,form,.,The,best,teachers,help,students,become,successful,learners,and,provide,them,with,the,skills,necessary,to,succeed,rather,than,simply,feeding,them,the,answers,.
I,agree,with,this,because,it,means,that,teachers,plant,ideas,into,their,heads,and,then,the,students,use,that,information,to,grow,.,Whether,or,not,they,agree,with,the,info,they,still,have,that,information,in,their,minds,.
Teachers,help,students,grow,by,giving,them,the,tools,and,support,to,achieve,.,This,is,like,a,plant,with,a,gardener,.
The,teacher,is,helping,us,all,grow,as,individuals,in,this,huge,world,we,live,in,.,We,are,learning,and,becoming,our,own,persons,.
Teachers,supply,the,tools,that,teach,students,to,think,and,helps,them,to,grow,intellectually,.
A,student,can,only,grow,when,somebody,is,tending,to,those,needs,so,this,is,a,good,example,.
That,makes,a,lot,of,sense,and,I,really,understand,where,they,are,going,with,this,.
The,teacher,is,giving,the,students,what,they,need,to,grow,as,a,person,and,grow,into,their,future,careers,.
Teachers,do,not,have,the,level,of,control,and,responsibility,that,gardeners,have,over,plants,when,talking,about,students,.,Theres,not,that,much,they,can,do,if,students,dont,care,.
I,think,this,is,pretty,true,because,students,have,the,opportunity,to,grow,in,a,class,.,A,teacher,can,cultivate,them,and,help,them,learn,and,develop,into,something,bigger,and,stronger,.
The,teacher,tends,to,the,students,and,helps,them,grow,with,daily,care,.,The,teacher,provides,an,environment,for,growth,.
As,a,teacher,I,am,sure,that,you,see,growth,in,students,.,In,this,way,I,can,see,how,teaching,provides,food,for,us,plants,so,we,can,grow,.
The,parents,are,the,gardeners,.,Teachers,are,the,florist,or,the,cook,.
This,is,just,like,the,sculptor,metaphor,.,These,are,getting,to,be,redundant,.,The,teacher,waters,the,students,with,knowledge,and,they,grow,.
I,do,not,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,teachers,do,not,usually,provide,the,students,with,everything,that,they,need,to,grow,in,their,own,career,.
A,gardener,is,someone,that,shapes,a,garden,to,their,liking,.,A,teacher,is,someone,that,helps,students,achieve,their,independence,.
Plants,serve,a,purpose,and,a,gardner,tends,and,monitors,the,plants,to,make,them,grow,.,Teacher,need,to,make,students,useful,and,tend,to,them,and,let,them,grow,.
A,teacher,can,grow,a,student,into,different,levels,of,education,but,he,does,not,have,the,ability,to,decide,what,kind,of,plant,a,student,becomes,.
This,is,just,like,the,clay,analogy,.,The,teacher,is,in,control,here,.,They,have,all,of,the,power,.,They,decide,whether,or,not,the,garden,is,beautiful,or,not,.,They,do,have,a,vested,interest,in,helping,the,students,grow,but,the,students,have,no,say,in,the,matter,.,They,just,respond,to,stimuli,.
This,makes,student,completely,passive,.,The,students,as,plants,depend,completely,on,the,action,of,the,teacher,which,shouldnt,be,the,case,.,It,makes,the,process,of,educating,overly,simple,formulaic,and,easy,with,both,teacher,and,students,not,really,working,hard,.
The,gardener,often,tries,to,get,plants,to,grow,and,do,better,.,A,teacher,is,doing,the,same,thing,in,the,classroom,as,the,gardener,would,do,.
Nurturing,people,is,something,that,young,people,in,college,are,not,in,need,of,.,They,need,guidance,and,helpful,information,to,be,able,to,make,it,in,a,very,competitive,world,and,dont,need,nuturing,.,They,need,knowledge,and,need,to,become,aware,of,what,the,real,world,is,all,about,through,learning,.
A,teacher,helps,students,grow,.,They,want,their,students,to,fully,grow,with,the,learning,process,.
I,think,that,a,teacher,is,a,gardener,who,only,knows,about,trees,but,is,growing,watermelon,.
The,professor,helps,them,grow,to,become,successful,.,The,professor,has,plenty,of,resources,needed,to,help,students,.,If,students,are,like,the,plants,than,they,can,live,off,of,the,professor,to,get,what,they,need,and,to,grow,.
Students,in,college,already,know,a,lot,of,things,and,the,professor,teaches,them,information,in,a,narrow,field,not,to,be,taught,how,to,think
This,one,makes,it,sound,like,there,is,a,lot,less,effort,involved,in,teaching,and,learning,than,is,generally,the,case,.,I,think,it,gives,too,little,credit,to,teachers,.
Because,a,gardener,only,takes,care,of,plants,growth,and,health,while,a,teacher,must,teach,and,get,through,to,students,.
I,guess,thats,somewhat,true,in,that,students,ultimately,grow,on,their,own,but,a,teacher,might,help,the,process,along,.
Teachers,give,the,students,what,they,need,to,grow,.,Just,like,a,gardener,gives,the,plants,what,they,need,to,grow,.
Teacher,is,like,a,gardener,who,does,his,best,to,put,out,the,sun,and,water,.,Students,are,supposed,to,be,a,little,more,active,than,plants,but,sure,.
The,teacher,as,the,gardener,can,not,mold,the,students,as,flowers,.,The,student,can,choose,to,learn,the,material,by,themselves,.,A,flower,can,not,grow,without,the,nutrients,provided,by,the,gardener,.
Somewhat,agree,in,the,sense,that,a,good,teacher,can,plant,the,seeds,of,new,ideas,in,a,new,student,and,help,weed,out,the,bad,ideas,that,might,hold,them,back,.
This,metaphor,makes,the,teacher,seems,like,someone,who,is,invested,in,their,students,and,wants,them,to,reach,their,full,potential,with,careful,and,consistent,attention,.,The,teachers,will,one,day,reap,what,they,sow,in,seeing,their,students,become,successful,in,their,field,of,study,.
A,teacher,carefully,cultivates,the,student,into,becoming,a,successful,person,.,The,teacher,gives,the,student,the,things,the,student,needs,to,successfully,grown,into,a,productive,person,just,like,a,gardener,cultivates,the,plant,.
I,love,this,simile,!,A,teacher,gardener,guides,and,encourages,and,nourishes,a,student,plant,with,what,it,needs,to,excel,.
The,teacher,is,more,like,the,plants,because,they,are,already,made,and,are,adults,teaching,the,children,.,They,have,built,themselves,up,like,a,plant,and,now,the,gardener,the,children,have,to,do,work,and,find,success,like,the,teacher,taught,them,.
The,teacher,spends,time,tending,to,their,students,just,like,a,gardener,does,and,doing,things,to,nurture,them,and,help,them,grow,like,water,them,give,them,food,make,sure,they,have,good,conditions,to,thrive,.,If,they,do,this,they,will,grow,and,thrive,.,If,they,neglect,the,students,they,will,wilt,and,not,learn,.
This,is,also,a,good,metaphor,students,grow,and,change,with,their,teachers,aid,and,each,student,becomes,a,unique,individual,.
I,dont,agree,that,students,are,really,plants,because,theyre,sentient,beings,capable,of,making,their,own,decisions,.,However,I,do,agree,that,a,teacher,should,nurture,knowledge,and,help,the,students,grow,.
I,could,see,this,being,apt,if,the,students,are,getting,a,lot,from,the,experience,and,growing,like,a,plant,.,But,this,metaphor,places,more,of,the,responsibility,on,the,teacher,and,in,real,life,it,is,the,students,who,have,to,mature,or,wither,not,the,gardener,.
Just,like,a,gardener,helps,plants,grow,a,teacher,helps,students,grow,.
This,is,better,than,the,sculpture,analogy,because,it,has,the,same,strengths,but,puts,more,limits,on,the,teacher,.,Plants,grow,due,to,many,factors,.,The,gardener,tries,to,influence,but,like,a,teacher,is,limited,.
The,teacher,is,watering,the,students,with,knowledge,and,feeding,them,nutrients,so,that,they,can,grow,big,and,strong,.
This,is,a,decent,metaphor,.,The,teachers,impart,knowledge,that,helps,the,students,grow,just,like,a,gardener,feeds,and,waters,the,plants,to,help,them,grow,.
I,could,see,what,they,mean,.,The,gardener,works,to,care,for,and,tend,to,the,plants,.,If,they,dont,take,careful,action,the,plants,could,wither,away,to,nothing,.,They,could,also,grow,out,of,control,.,A,gardener,would,provide,what,they,need,to,grow,properly,.
College,teachers,try,to,cultivate,strong,thinking,skills,.,The,course,a,student,is,on,is,pretty,set,like,a,plant,but,as,with,gardening,a,teacher,can,influence,how,well,a,student,grows,in,their,thinking,.
I,disagree,because,most,things,we,are,taught,are,useless,.,This,applies,more,to,parents,than,children,.
Teachers,help,students,grow,just,like,plants,in,a,garden,start,off,as,a,seed,and,nothing,then,they,grow,because,they,are,being,taken,care,of,.
This,is,a,pretty,good,metaphor,as,the,teacher,provides,inputs,and,the,student,takes,it,and,grows,.
Like,a,garden,you,are,trying,to,nurture,your,plants,the,same,with,a,teacher,they,are,slowly,watching,your,brain,grow,.
Teachers,have,to,water,their,students,with,knowledge,.,They,feed,knowledge,to,their,students,and,have,to,keep,their,brains,fresh,and,neat,.
This,seems,very,similar,to,the,sculptor,or,clay,metaphor,and,I,agree,with,it,to,a,degree,.,The,growing,and,learning,of,the,students,is,largely,in,the,hands,of,the,professor,.,They,are,the,ones,who,know,where,theyre,going,and,how,they,have,to,get,there,.,However,just,like,with,the,previous,metaphor,this,one,fails,to,place,onus,on,the,students,themselves,.,Plants,do,basically,nothing,but,sit,there,.,Students,must,be,far,more,active,in,their,own,educations,to,learn,or,accomplish,anything,regardless,of,the,actions,of,the,teacher,.
A,teacher,tends,to,her,students,like,a,gardener,as,they,help,to,make,them,grow,as,a,person,.
This,metaphor,makes,sense,since,gardeners,cultivate,plants,like,teachers,have,to,cultivate,students,to,foster,a,positive,learning,experience,and,environment,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,and,students,are,like,plants,because,the,water,is,the,knowledge,that,the,teacher,is,giving,the,students,.,The,more,knowledge,the,more,the,students,have,a,chance,to,grow,.
A,teacher,doesnt,raise,and,care,for,students,from,birth,like,a,gardener,does,with,plants,.,A,gardener,is,more,like,a,parent,.
The,teacher,transforms,the,plants,and,shapes,them,to,be,great,in,many,senses,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,since,they,are,attending,to,the,plants,students,and,giving,them,nourishment,in,the,form,of,knowledge,.
I,somewhat,agree,with,this,metaphor,in,the,sense,that,the,teacher,can,mold,the,students,into,having,certain,beliefs,about,certain,things,.,The,teacher,pushes,their,beliefs,on,students,.
Im,not,fond,of,this,analogy,because,plants,do,not,have,the,capability,to,respond,outside,of,their,original,placement,.,They,can,grow,but,they,can,not,change,no,matter,how,the,gardener,tends,to,it,.,This,is,an,important,distinction,and,it,is,that,distinction,which,makes,this,not,so,good,.
This,one,is,good,too,and,really,depicts,a,teacher,and,their,operations,they,go,through,.,Really,showcasing,how,they,carry,themselves,.
This,metaphor,is,more,appropriate,than,the,last,one,.,Teachers,do,tend,to,their,students,nurturing,them,and,helping,them,grow,.,They,can,even,be,the,people,who,remove,obstacles,i.e,.,weeds,from,the,students,growth,.,The,problem,is,that,the,teacher,didnt,plant,the,students,.,Their,parents,did,.,their,parents,instilled,a,basic,love,for,learning,or,for,subject,matter,so,the,students,would,want,to,grow,in,that,area,.
They,tend,and,grow,their,pupils,intellectual,health,.
