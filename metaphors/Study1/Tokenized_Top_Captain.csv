CaptainExplain
This,metaphor,would,work,if,you,think,of,a,room,like,a,ship,and,the,journey,one,of,subject,knowledge,.,The,teacher,is,the,leader,which,guides,the,year,and,the,students,learn,from,this,leader,.
The,teacher,is,like,a,captain,guiding,the,students,and,driving,their,ship,and,the,students,are,like,the,sailors,navigating,the,educational,waters,with,the,teacher,as,their,guide,.
The,captain,is,responsible,for,his,ship,class,and,that,ship,isnt,going,anywhere,if,you,havent,educated,your,sailors,.,A,teacher,should,be,leading,that,class,.,He,or,she,should,be,guiding,students,by,making,sure,they,are,covering,the,assigned,material,in,class,giving,an,opportunity,to,ask,questions,and,helping,find,the,answers,.,It,is,a,journey,that,the,teacher,and,students,are,both,embarking,on,.,By,giving,your,students,the,tools,they,need,to,succeed,and,leading,them,you,will,help,them,reach,beyond,their,goals,.
I,like,this,analogy,because,it,implies,that,the,ship,wont,go,anywhere,if,the,students,are,not,in,sync,with,the,teacher,.,The,teacher,knows,how,to,sail,the,boat,but,to,get,moving,he,must,teach,the,students,what,he,knows,.,A,classroom,too,is,a,structure,without,purpose,if,the,students,arent,able,to,haul,up,the,anchor,as,it,were,.
The,teacher,is,the,overseer,of,the,vessel,that,is,education,.,The,students,are,workers,that,help,keep,the,ship,going,and,they,defer,to,the,captain,for,help,in,their,educational,journey,.
This,is,a,great,metaphor,for,the,studentteacher,relationships,because,a,ships,captain,is,responsible,for,steering,the,ship,and,the,safety,of,all,the,passengers,much,like,the,teacher,is,responsible,for,steering,all,the,students,in,the,right,direction,.
I,like,this,metaphor,a,lot,.,The,teacher,is,at,the,helm,steering,the,ship,to,whatever,port,of,call,will,be,the,most,instructive,.,Maybe,were,learning,about,American,agriculture,today,so,off,the,boat,goes,to,the,port,of,Des,Moines,to,learn,about,corn,wheat,and,soy,.,Were,the,students,shanghaied,?,Maybe,a,bit,.,But,for,the,most,part,they,signed,on,for,this,voyage,.
This,puts,the,professor,fully,in,charge,of,the,game,with,no,input,from,students,except,for,doing,grunt,work,.,I,dont,like,that,simile,at,all,.,There,should,be,more,interaction,between,parties,.
This,metaphor,isnt,totally,true,as,there,is,not,growth,or,learning,aspect,to,it,.,Sailors,are,more,just,hired,hands,to,a,captain,.
I,agree,with,the,metaphor,.,But,I,see,the,captain,as,teaching,the,students,how,to,be,the,captain,.,Do,students,just,follow,orders,?
The,students,are,not,there,to,help,run,the,ship,they,are,there,to,gain,knowledge,so,this,comparison,I,do,not,feel,is,as,good,as,some,of,the,others,.,Sailors,assist,the,captain,with,a,lot,of,the,ship,work,.
You,have,to,follow,the,orders,of,your,professor,or,captain,or,else,you,will,suffer,the,consequences,.,In,the,classroom,this,translates,to,poor,grades,.
The,teacher,definitely,is,the,leader,in,the,classroom,and,the,students,follow,him,or,her,on,a,journey,.,But,a,captain,is,supposed,to,have,his,sailors,best,interest,at,heart,.,Sometimes,teachers,dont,.
This,could,work,.,Like,the,teachers,are,in,charge,of,the,ship,they,are,charting,the,course,of,the,education,but,students,have,to,do,the,hard,work,to,make,the,course,happen,.
I,agree,because,teachers,do,guide,the,course,for,students,.,They,lead,the,way,but,the,students,must,steer,.
When,the,teacher,is,perfect,only,we,can,able,to,learn,so,many,things,and,also,he,guides,us,to,do,so,many,things,they,were,like,a,pathway,in,our,life,to,teach,us,so,many,new,things,.
I,actually,disagree,with,this,one,.,I,stated,earlier,that,to,me,when,you,reach,college,you,are,more,on,an,equal,playing,ground,.,Maybe,it,is,because,I,was,older,when,I,chose,to,attend,college,but,I,did,not,feel,as,if,they,were,in,charge,.,I,felt,that,even,though,they,had,knowledge,on,the,subject,there,was,never,a,relationship,that,they,were,above,me,as,the,leader,and,I,was,the,follower,like,a,captain,and,sailors,.
Calling,the,teacher,the,captain,and,students,the,sailors,makes,it,seem,more,like,the,professor,is,in,charge,and,the,students,are,simply,yes,men,or,women,who,are,to,follow,the,professors,every,command,.,I,dont,think,a,good,classroom,environment,works,like,this,.
Teachers,should,steer,students,minds,in,the,direction,of,passion,and,curiosity,.
The,teacher,steers,the,ship,.,The,students,are,mere,workers,and,follow,orders,.,That,is,all,I,believe,.
Captain,of,the,ship,is,the,person,in,charge,and,sets,direction,and,people,must,follow,and,not,veer,off,course,.,If,a,teacher,does,this,it,does,not,expand,thinking,of,the,students,.
The,captain,of,a,ship,is,like,the,guide,that,the,sailors,follow,.,The,teacher,is,also,a,guide,that,the,students,follow,on,their,academic,journey,.
At,least,this,one,involves,people,.,Students,are,like,sailors,in,the,way,they,have,to,participate,.,They,cant,just,be,immobile,objects,moved,around,.,They,have,to,be,active,to,move,the,ship,.,If,they,arent,they,and,the,ship,wont,go,anywhere,.
I,dont,see,this,one,applying,too,much,most,teachers,in,college,are,not,leaders,unless,theyre,deans,or,heads,of,some,organization,.,So,I,dont,strongly,disagree,but,most,teachers,arent,looking,to,navigate,their,own,ship,with,the,students,as,crew,.,Maybe,time,to,time,in,certain,settings,.,In,general,the,teacher,is,more,like,a,tour,boat,guide,.
This,works,.,Not,all,the,time,but,works,especially,for,advanced,classes,.,Here,the,teacher,and,student,are,on,the,same,team,trying,find,the,truth,or,reach,a,destination,.,This,is,how,seminars,are,often,taught,.,But,introductory,classes,are,different,.,Students,can,not,yet,help,the,professor,the,way,a,sailor,helps,the,captain,.
The,teacher,is,the,leader,in,the,classroom,.,They,know,how,to,steer,the,conversation,about,facts,of,the,subject,.,The,students,or,sailors,must,understand,every,command,to,get,experience,.
I,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,the,sailors,follow,the,lead,of,the,captain,.,The,students,agree,to,study,and,listen,to,what,the,teacher,is,saying,.,The,teacher,is,the,one,who,sets,the,path,that,the,students,follow,just,like,a,captain,of,a,ship,sets,the,path,for,the,sailors,.
Its,a,little,less,refined,than,the,coach,and,athlete,analogy,but,its,similar,.,The,captain,simply,navigates,and,helps,keep,things,in,line,as,well,as,provides,direction,.,The,sailors,are,responsible,for,implementing,this,as,well,as,taking,care,of,their,other,responsibilities,.,Its,not,quite,as,good,of,an,analogy,though,.
