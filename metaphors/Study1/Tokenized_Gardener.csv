Firstly,these,are,similes,not,metaphors,.,Now,to,my,justification,Some,students,are,more,malleable,than,others,and,are,more,easily,influenced,by,the,ideas,of,professors,.,Conversely,a,student,may,be,repulsed,if,a,particular,professors,beliefs,are,out,of,line,with,the,students,.,The,teachers,ability,to,sculpt,rather,than,support,a,students,progress,depends,on,many,things,personality,teaching,style,and,the,receptiveness,of,the,student,.
Teachers,help,mold,students,.,However,they,arent,the,end,all,be,all,.
This,metaphor,makes,total,sense,as,teachers,shape,their,students,and,mold,them,into,better,people,.
Teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,and,student,is,like,a,clay,to,teach,to,succeed,in,our,life,.
If,a,student,wants,to,be,changed,the,professor,is,the,one,to,change,them,.,I,think,professors,have,a,great,impact,on,students,.
Id,rather,teachers,be,compared,to,gardeners,or,guides,rather,than,sculptors,.,The,verb,mold,makes,me,feel,as,if,teachers,are,forcing,their,views,onto,the,students,which,we,may,sometimes,do,rather,than,leading,them,through,to,the,different,answers,.,This,rubbed,me,the,wrong,way,.
I,agree,with,that,statement,.,They,are,a,good,sculptor,a,good,citizen,.,Clients,are,clay,because,they,need,to,be,molded,to,form,their,dignity,and,social,status,.
In,a,way,yes,.,You,sculpt,their,learning,.
In,college,you,are,taught,methodologies,as,much,as,facts,.,Most,people,can,do,these,methodologies,with,training,but,it,takes,a,good,teacher,to,explain,how,they,work,and,get,people,to,follow,them,.
A,teachers,teachings,will,allow,students,to,form,into,the,person,that,they,want,to,be,with,the,learnings,.
This,one,is,weird,sounding,.,I,suppose,because,the,clay,is,inanimate,and,doesnt,really,have,an,action,itself,.,You,hear,people,say,all,the,time,that,the,teacher,is,molding,the,students,but,I,dont,personally,like,this,metaphor,.,The,sculptor,is,not,teaching,the,clay,anything,and,is,not,taking,care,of,or,nourishing,the,clay,really,.
I,dont,think,that,the,professors,have,the,responsibility,of,sculpting,students,.,Students,have,to,accept,what,they,say,and,agree,or,disagree,with,what,the,professor,says,.
I,mean,it,kind,of,makes,sense,but,Im,not,molding,myself,to,be,the,professor,.,Im,using,his,knowledge,to,better,myself,and,go,my,own,way,.,He,may,teach,things,but,Im,going,to,implement,them,my,own,way,.
The,teacher,uses,his,or,her,experiences,and,knowledge,to,help,shape,the,students,minds,to,get,them,to,better,grasp,what,they,are,being,taught,.
Of,course,teachers,are,sculptor,and,students,are,clay,because,they,provide,a,shape,and,help,us,to,be,in,great,position,so,teachers,are,considered,as,sculptors,.
College,professors,do,everything,they,can,to,indoctrinate,their,students,with,their,views,and,biases,.,So,they,attempt,to,sculpt,the,students,to,think,just,like,them,.
Not,really,this,implies,the,teacher,is,responsible,for,molding,the,student,.,I,think,it,is,the,students,responsibility,to,learn,from,the,teacher,.
The,teacher,is,molding,the,students,into,better,people,more,educated,people,about,their,subject,.,But,it,is,also,better,suited,for,a,parent,to,be,the,molder,than,a,teacher,.
Eh,.,I,guess,that,this,one,is,a,little,ok,.,But,you,cant,shape,people,that,much,its,more,like,the,people,are,almost,like,wood,.,Sure,you,can,try,to,do,a,bit,but,its,not,going,to,change,much,.
A,teacher,creates,a,person,by,the,way,they,teach,.
I,like,this,metaphor,because,a,good,professor,can,engage,their,students,and,mold,them,per,se,by,providing,engaging,learning,opportunities,which,enhance,and,challenge,their,students,.
I,think,that,this,is,a,perfect,example,because,students,are,basically,there,to,learn,.,They,are,at,the,teachers,whims,.
It,occurs,to,me,that,the,role,of,the,teacher,is,not,to,mold,the,student,so,much,as,that,would,be,more,like,what,a,mentor,would,do,.,A,teacher,is,a,bit,more,hands,off,than,that,.
Minds,are,empty,of,the,subject,matter,and,ready,to,be,shaped,.
Dont,get,caught,putting,your,hands,on,the,students,.
I,would,deem,this,correct,as,teachers,do,mold,students,.,They,shape,the,minds,and,thoughts,of,their,pupils,.
I,think,this,is,true,.,As,long,as,the,students,are,willing,to,be,sculpted,but,even,the,most,stubborn,student,will,be,sculpted,a,little,bit,even,if,it,is,unwillingly,.
The,teacher,sculpts,the,students,and,helps,them,in,their,educational,journeys,and,to,be,successful,in,their,studies,as,a,sculptor,sculpts,clay,into,something,better,and,more,interesting,than,a,block,of,clay,.
Again,I,can,agree,with,this,metaphor,.,The,sculptor,will,guide,the,clay,along,the,wheel,much,as,it,is,the,responsibility,of,the,teacher,to,guide,their,students,on,the,wheel,of,learning,.,What,begins,as,a,crude,interest,can,be,molded,and,shaped,into,an,accomplished,polished,mastery,of,the,material,.
The,teachers,are,the,ones,who,teach,the,students,in,their,course,that,is,they,give,the,information,and,the,students,are,molded,to,this,.
Students,are,impressionable,and,need,to,be,guided,into,shape,.,Teachers,play,a,significant,hand,in,molding,the,students,into,responsible,intelligent,adults,.
Sort,of,.,Yes,students,can,be,molded,into,what,their,teacher,shares,and,offers,but,this,is,only,one,piece,of,the,many,factors,that,will,decide,how,the,student,grows,.,I,agree,in,theory,but,this,metaphor,is,loosely,stated,.
It,means,that,the,student,doesnt,know,any,things,about,the,outside,world,.,Teacher,teaches,all,the,lessons,in,order,to,survive,the,world,and,also,he,teaches,us,about,the,upcoming,technologies,and,also,the,teacher,uses,us,to,learn,many,good,things,.
It,makes,sense,because,the,teacher,is,sculpting,the,student,into,the,form,that,they,want,them,to,be,through,teaching,.
A,teacher,can,highly,influence,a,young,minds,thoughts,and,perceptions,.,They,cant,necessarily,turn,students,into,entirely,different,people,but,they,can,offer,insightful,opinions,and,advice,.
I,think,that,the,teacher,is,the,one,with,the,knowledge,in,a,classroom,.,The,student,is,going,to,this,class,to,learn,what,the,teacher,already,knows,.,The,teacher,has,to,decide,how,to,present,this,knowledge,to,the,students,.,they,have,the,knowledge,and,are,giving,it,away,to,the,students,.,How,they,choose,to,give,this,knowledge,away,is,how,they,are,molding,the,students,like,clay,.,They,are,providing,the,knowledge,they,already,know,and,they,are,making,the,students,smarter,and,getting,them,one,step,closer,to,where,they,want,to,be,.
I,dont,see,teachers,as,shaping,the,students,into,what,they,want,but,its,more,of,a,giving,of,knowledge,arrangement,and,the,students,can,make,of,the,information,what,they,will,rather,than,just,becoming,a,product,of,what,the,teacher,says,.
This,analogy,sort,of,fits,a,sculptor,takes,something,thats,why,I,turn,it,into,something,refined,.,Its,kind,of,the,same,thing,with,the,college,teacher,they,have,these,kids,with,blank,slates,and,they,tried,to,fill,them,with,knowledge,.
Students,are,there,to,absorb,information,taught,to,them,by,the,professor,so,I,think,comparing,them,to,an,artist,and,a,work,of,art,is,a,fair,comparison,.,Just,like,the,artist,wont,be,successful,if,their,work,is,garbage,a,professor,should,be,judged,on,the,success,of,his,or,her,students,.,The,students,need,the,teacher,to,teach,them,in,order,to,grow,and,mature,.,Sometimes,a,great,teacher,can,change,a,students,life,and,or,or,career,path,.
I,dont,completely,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,it,implies,that,students,dont,think,for,themselves,.,College,students,are,probably,one,of,the,most,opinionated,types,of,people,.,A,teacher,doesnt,mold,their,minds,but,adds,to,it,.
Students,come,to,college,hoping,to,learn,and,professors,have,the,duty,to,challenge,and,educate,them,.
I,can,agree,somewhat,with,this,.,The,teacher,is,sculpting,our,minds,to,be,the,person,we,are,meant,to,be,.,We,start,off,with,the,unknown,but,then,our,minds,can,turn,into,something,amazing,.
Teachers,have,the,power,to,mold,their,students,as,they,see,fit,.
Students,have,open,minds,and,are,ready,to,absorb,the,knowledge,given,to,them,so,I,definitely,agree,.,Clay,is,nothing,without,a,sculptor,students,can,not,absorb,knowledge,without,a,guide,.
That,makes,a,lot,of,sense,a,teacher,teaches,the,students,and,sculpts,them,into,educated,humans,.
The,college,teacher,is,molding,the,students,.,They,are,preparing,them,for,their,future,career,and,giving,them,the,structure,they,need,to,accomplish,that,.
Clay,will,allow,anyone,to,sculpt,it,.,Students,are,not,like,that,.,Some,are,simply,not,receptive,to,the,sculpting,.
I,think,that,is,very,true,.,The,teacher,can,really,impart,a,lot,to,the,student,and,influence,them,in,many,ways,.,It,is,not,completely,true,because,people,come,with,their,own,sets,of,characteristics,that,can,not,be,changed,but,to,an,extent,it,is,true,.
The,teacher,molds,students,and,shows,them,new,shapes,.,Students,are,raw,materials,to,be,shaped,and,guided,.
Before,we,entered,the,class,we,didnt,know,anything,about,the,subject,.,We,were,just,an,unfinished,block,of,clay,.,As,we,learned,we,were,able,to,carve,out,pieces,of,the,block,and,reveal,what,is,hidden,in,it,.,At,the,end,of,the,class,it,actually,looks,like,something,and,has,been,formed,.
I,wouldnt,say,clay,.,I,would,say,students,are,like,wood,.,They,are,rough,and,unformed,but,are,solid,.,They,have,strong,but,undefined,form,.
A,teacher,uses,the,students,that,are,like,a,ball,of,clay,and,molds,them,into,a,worker,.,He,teaches,them,what,they,need,to,know,in,order,to,be,a,functioning,human,being,.
I,do,not,think,that,metaphor,is,accurate,because,in,college,students,are,more,likely,to,learn,from,themselves,than,they,are,from,their,professor,.,When,I,was,in,college,I,stopped,paying,attention,to,my,teachers,after,my,freshman,year,.,I,was,still,able,to,finish,school,with,above,a,3.0,GPA,.
A,teacher,should,not,sculpt,the,student,to,be,what,they,want,the,student,to,be,.,The,teacher,should,encourage,the,students,curiosity,and,help,them,when,they,need,help,.
The,student,is,uninformed,when,they,start,a,class,.,A,lump,of,clay,.,the,teacher,molds,the,student,with,knowledge,to,form,a,knowledgeable,student,.
A,teacher,may,mold,a,student,to,some,extent,but,with,free,will,and,other,influences,the,ability,to,do,so,is,very,much,limited,.
This,analogy,is,okay,.,It,places,the,responsibility,for,creating,a,beautiful,work,entirely,in,the,teachers,hands,which,Im,not,fond,of,.,On,the,one,hand,it,encourages,the,teacher,to,really,look,at,their,class,like,a,passion,project,.,On,the,other,hand,though,the,students,are,left,with,the,options,of,being,cooperative,clay,or,not,I,guess,?
This,makes,the,students,sound,completely,passive,which,I,dont,like,.,Education,is,a,result,of,the,teacher,and,the,student,cooperating,.,Students,have,choices,and,different,interests,and,arent,just,molded,by,the,teachers,.
A,scultor,sculpts,the,clay,into,a,finished,product,.,A,teacher,also,modifies,what,the,students,know,into,something,that,is,a,finished,product,.
This,metaphor,is,misleading,as,it,is,saying,that,the,teacher,can,shape,a,person,into,something,that,they,arent,.,People,usually,have,their,own,impressions,or,abilities,that,a,teacher,may,not,know,about,and,unless,they,learn,about,the,student,they,arent,molding,anyone,into,anything,.
A,teacher,will,mold,their,students,into,being,well,educated,human,beings,.
Often,times,we,find,teachers,trying,to,mold,students,into,what,they,see,fit,instead,of,what,they,want,to,be,.
A,professor,is,there,to,guide,them,which,is,sculpting,them,with,the,knowledge,they,need,.,Students,can,be,soft,and,easy,to,work,with,if,theyre,given,the,resources,theyre,interested,in,learning,with,.
Students,are,independent,thinkers,and,are,not,malleable,like,elementary,school,teachers,.
This,is,the,most,imaginative,so,far,.,The,teacher,uses,his,or,her,experience,and,expertise,to,try,to,mold,the,students,into,a,more,complete,form,.,However,one,teacher,in,one,class,does,not,a,finished,sculpture,or,student,make,.
Because,a,sculptor,creates,the,sculpture,while,a,teacher,only,helps,teach,or,develop,an,existing,students,inner,knowledge,.
I,dont,think,this,works,because,it,implies,that,all,the,work,is,done,by,the,teacher,and,none,by,the,student,.
I,get,the,metaphor,when,it,comes,to,younger,students,but,college,students,are,more,like,stone,with,the,teacher,is,the,sculptor,in,that,sense,.
Students,should,be,a,little,more,than,a,lump,of,dirt,but,it,is,nice,to,imagine,them,as,moldable,.
The,teacher,does,not,really,sculpt,the,kids,similar,to,sculpture,to,clay,.,the,student,can,choose,to,learn,the,material,themselves,without,the,need,of,the,teacher,.
Disagree,.,Again,in,this,situation,the,students,are,passive,.,Good,students,are,active,learners,.,Good,teachers,provide,back,and,forth,with,students,.,The,students,should,mold,the,teacher,as,well,.
I,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,teachers,have,a,large,influence,on,what,their,students,learn,and,potentially,mold,their,students,outlook,on,the,field,of,study,.
A,teacher,molds,the,students,thoughts,and,ideas,.,They,help,the,student,form,into,a,person,who,thinks,for,themselves,.
I,tend,to,disagree,with,this,because,I,dont,think,teachers,are,meant,to,mold,students,.,They,are,meant,to,educate,and,inspire,present,information,with,the,intention,of,having,their,students,form,their,own,ideas,and,assertions,.
The,teacher,sculpts,the,clay,for,their,children,that,they,are,teaching,.,They,are,molding,them,on,how,to,have,morals,and,intelligence,.,The,children,have,to,be,sculpted,in,order,to,learn,and,succeed,.
This,is,somewhat,true,in,the,sense,that,the,teacher,is,molding,and,shaping,the,students,through,what,they,teach,them,and,what,they,learn,but,especially,for,older,students,I,would,say,this,puts,too,much,emphasis,on,the,power,of,the,teacher,and,doesnt,give,any,power,to,students,.,Students,arent,just,helpless,lumps,of,clay,.,They,also,participate,and,can,contribute,to,the,outcome,.
While,I,agree,that,teachers,help,to,mold,students,I,again,feel,that,students,must,engage,and,have,an,active,role,in,molding,themselves,as,well,.
The,students,are,not,unmolded,raw,material,they,are,thinking,sentient,beings,.,They,shouldnt,be,sculpted,rather,they,should,be,given,the,information,without,any,external,spin,and,allowed,to,make,decisions,for,themselves,.
I,dont,believe,so,in,this,case,it,applies,much,.,Sometimes,a,teacher,will,mold,students,with,their,own,values,and,their,own,perspective,of,the,world,but,more,often,I,see,them,as,less,engaged,with,the,students,in,making,them,follow,a,certain,way,.,Although,it,can,happen,and,there,is,a,sort,of,rough,around,the,edges,aspect,that,does,apply,in,my,opinion,.
I,can,see,this,as,teachers,help,shape,students,.
A,little,too,strong,but,yes,there,is,an,aspect,of,molding,when,it,comes,to,teaching,.,The,professor,often,is,getting,students,to,think,in,a,certain,way,to,develop,certain,critical,skills,.
Its,like,a,teacher,is,sculpting,the,student,into,a,model,of,something,that,needs,to,be,made,.
This,analogy,is,okay,.,I,can,see,it,at,least,that,the,sculptor,forms,the,clay,but,students,are,learning,from,the,teacher,it,is,not,necessarily,a,forming,experience,.
I,can,understand,the,molding,of,a,student,but,I,dont,think,that,students,are,blocks,of,clay,that,are,only,molded,into,one,planned,thing,.,They,mold,themselves,.
College,professors,do,not,change,students,.,Students,personalities,and,core,traits,are,established,by,college,.

The,teacher,is,molding,the,students,into,what,they,can,be,in,the,future,and,they,are,molding,them,like,clay,to,be,the,best,that,they,can,.
This,is,too,heavy,of,an,emphasis,on,the,teacher,as,the,sculpture,has,no,role,other,than,existing,.
A,teacher,is,molding,your,brain,in,the,sense,that,you,start,out,with,some,clay,and,slowly,form,it,into,something,.
Teachers,mold,students,into,what,they,want,.,They,can,do,that,by,teaching,various,things,which,mold,the,children,and,their,lives,.
I,agree,partly,with,this,.,Students,have,much,more,influence,on,their,own,molding,than,the,quote,implies,.,However,in,general,the,educating,and,shaping,of,the,students,is,in,the,hands,of,the,professor,.,The,students,definitely,have,a,degree,of,helplessness,and,impotence,.,Without,the,professors,guidance,and,expertise,there,is,only,so,much,the,students,can,do,.
This,makes,sense,because,the,teacher,is,molding,their,brains,and,personalities,to,be,productive,members,of,society,.
The,metaphor,makes,sense,since,teachers,tend,to,shape,students,way,of,thinking,and,help,mold,them,into,slightly,different,versions,of,themselves,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,and,students,are,like,clay,because,the,teacher,is,shaping,the,students,minds,by,teaching,them,.
Teachers,dont,have,that,much,influence,on,students,.,Students,dont,start,out,as,a,blank,slate,.
A,teacher,helps,us,become,who,we,want,to,be,so,in,a,sense,we,are,like,clay,and,the,teacher,helps,us,transform,into,a,final,product,.
Its,a,great,metaphor,because,it,denotes,that,the,teacher,has,experience,sculptor,and,is,responsible,for,molding,young,minds,clay,.
I,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,the,teacher,is,the,one,who,pushes,his,beliefs,on,the,students,.,The,teacher,says,what,they,think,of,an,issue,and,the,students,agree,with,this,or,disagree,with,it,.,Some,students,get,molded,like,clay,.
This,is,not,as,good,because,clay,assumes,the,role,of,the,molded,.,The,sculptor,can,guide,but,there,is,a,difference,between,sculpting,your,own,image,and,guidance,.,Ideally,you,would,guide,them,to,build,their,own,.,This,analogy,turns,it,around,slightly,and,dilutes,the,meaning,.
This,is,a,perfect,metaphor,because,it,describes,exactly,how,a,teacher,would,carry,themselves,on,numerous,different,occasions,.,So,to,me,I,understand,it,100,%,.
And,here,we,are,back,in,the,kinda,sorta,maybe,category,.,I,heard,once,that,Michelangelo,said,that,his,job,wasnt,to,carve,the,statue,from,the,stone,it,was,to,simply,remove,all,the,bits,that,werent,the,statue,.,That,the,statue,was,already,inside,.,I,have,a,friend,who,works,in,clay,.,When,shes,throwing,clay,it,almost,feels,like,a,battle,to,get,the,clay,to,go,where,she,wants,it,to,go,.,So,that,part,could,be,accurate,.,I,think,a,more,accurate,metaphor,in,this,vein,would,be,that,the,students,were,apprentices,to,the,master,sculptor,their,teacher,and,the,teacher,was,merely,teaching,them,how,to,cut,away,the,bits,of,themselves,that,werent,their,true,self,.
They,mold,students,into,their,idea,of,a,student,but,I,think,most,molds,are,already,defined,.
