This,idea,is,more,in,line,with,what,I,believe,.,A,teacher,can,expose,a,student,to,many,landscapes,of,thought,and,the,student,is,invited,to,participate,.
Tour,guides,do,inform,but,they,are,more,informal,.
I,dont,like,this,metaphor,because,tourists,tend,to,only,be,temporary,visitors,to,the,information
Teacher,is,like,a,tourist,guide,and,student,is,like,a,tourist,to,guide,all,levels,of,techniques
A,tour,guide,shows,people,around,.,The,people,can,learn,as,much,as,they,want,to,with,or,without,the,guide,.
Students,are,touring,through,the,country,of,knowledge,in,whatever,subject,they,are,taking,.,The,teachers,are,the,experts,hopefully,and,guide,the,tourists,around,.

In,a,way,.,I,think,it,depends,on,the,subject,.
School,isnt,there,for,fun,nor,is,it,a,presentation,of,plain,facts,.,And,a,teacher,needs,to,be,actively,involved,rather,than,passively,showing,people,stuff,.,It,isnt,a,good,metaphor,.
A,teacher,shows,students,the,way,that,they,do,not,have,ideas,about,.
This,would,be,the,best,one,so,far,that,I,have,read,here,.,The,tour,guide,is,the,brains,of,the,operation,and,is,teaching,and,showing,the,tourists,about,everything,.,The,guide,is,literally,guiding,them,through,the,area,or,whatever,it,is,they,are,touring,and,knows,what,direction,to,lead,them,in,and,how,to,get,there,.,The,college,teacher,does,the,same,for,the,students,.
I,think,that,a,professor,is,more,than,a,tour,guide,.,They,do,indeed,have,the,knowledge,but,do,not,just,spit,out,stuff,and,students,listen,.,They,have,a,deeper,understanding,of,the,content,.
I,just,dont,have,this,metaphor,resonating,with,me,at,all,a,tourist,just,kind,of,looks,around,at,things,and,doesnt,do,much,of,anything,.,And,a,tour,guide,?,Seems,a,bit,demeaning,.
The,teach,is,bringing,them,on,a,journey,but,I,think,I,only,somewhat,agree,because,a,tour,guide,is,providing,a,more,passive,experience,whereas,a,teacher,is,usually,there,to,get,the,subject,the,knowledge,embedded,and,deeply,understood,.
Teachers,guide,on,various,things,and,explain,it,to,us,clearly,so,they,are,considered,as,tour,guides,.
I,agree,with,this,because,a,tour,guide,shows,tourists,what,the,guide,wants,the,to,see,in,his,or,her,city,.,Similarly,professors,only,share,the,information,and,studies,with,their,students,that,they,want,to,.
Yes,the,teachers,are,describing,and,explaining,topics,that,they,are,experts,on,while,the,students,are,learning,.
This,makes,sense,because,the,teachers,are,leading,the,tour,and,passing,along,information,to,the,tour,participants,.
No,.,Teachers,actually,teach,people,the,things,that,they,need,to,learn,not,just,show,things,and,shuffle,along,.
Students,need,to,be,led,the,way,and,the,proper,guide,shows,them,the,way,.
Teachers,are,able,to,provide,a,variety,of,learning,opportunities,in,some,cases,involving,various,subject,matters,particularly,in,elementary,school,settings,.,Therefore,the,learning,becomes,multifaceted,.
I,think,that,this,metaphor,works,.,This,is,because,a,teacher,guides,the,students,throughout,life,and,the,ride,is,only,temporary,.
I,dont,feel,like,the,idea,of,the,teacher,as,a,tour,guide,is,accurate,at,all,and,the,students,as,tourists,just,doesnt,fit,or,make,much,sense,even,.
They,show,students,around,the,block,a,few,times,.
youre,not,going,anywhere,physically,I,guess,.
A,teacher,does,show,things,to,students,.,They,guide,them,to,knowledge,and,the,student,must,absorb,it,.
Taking,a,college,class,is,like,visiting,a,place,you,have,never,been,before,and,the,class,covers,a,lot,that,you,may,or,may,not,remember,.
The,teacher,guides,the,students,in,their,educational,journeys,and,the,students,are,like,the,tourists,on,the,tour,and,looking,forward,for,their,education,and,in,their,studies,to,learn,more,.
I,dont,think,this,is,a,very,strong,metaphor,but,still,applicable,as,it,is,a,tour,guides,job,to,gather,his,tourists,and,educate,them,about,the,world,around,them,.
I,totally,agree,since,the,teacher,is,the,one,who,gives,the,walk,in,terms,of,the,profession,.
Teachers,should,know,the,material,and,be,able,to,teach,it,.,They,are,the,guide,for,the,students,who,are,just,tourists,until,they,are,there,long,enough,that,they,learn,the,information,to,become,guides,themselves,.
Again,I,agree,.,A,teacher,is,there,to,show,students,things,they,have,never,considered,before,.,Not,just,regarding,the,tangible,but,also,in,things,that,are,not,tangible,such,as,knowledge,.
Teacher,tell,us,how,to,survive,in,the,outside,world,and,also,give,some,tips,and,guts,and,they,encourage,us,to,pick,out,our,talents,and,also,they,boost,up,in,order,that,you,can,be,able,to,do,this,I,will,be,there,for,your,support,.
I,agree,with,this,for,the,most,part,.,A,tour,guide,educates,tourists,about,the,area,and,what,they,are,exploring,.,And,the,tourists,are,there,to,learn,about,that,particular,subject,.,Just,like,in,college,where,you,choose,to,learn,about,a,subject,and,the,teacher,is,there,to,educate,.
A,teacher,is,supposed,to,teach,us,about,the,unknown,.,We,are,tourists,in,an,unfamiliar,location,and,they,are,the,guides,with,adequate,knowledge,about,our,surroundings,.
Many,of,these,statements,are,pretty,much,coming,down,to,the,same,thing,.,The,teacher,is,the,tour,guide,.,They,already,know,their,way,around,this,specific,subject,.,They,are,guiding,the,students,in,this,subject,and,helping,them,learn,and,understand,what,is,around,them,.
Students,dont,have,all,the,knowledge,about,a,subject,and,the,teacher,is,like,a,guide,in,that,they,can,inform,the,students,about,the,subject,at,hand,.,Students,are,often,stupid,like,tourists,as,well,floundering,about,with,no,idea,what,is,going,on,.
The,teacher,needs,to,lead,them,guide,them,and,show,them,different,things,that,they,have,never,experienced,before,.,In,this,way,the,teacher,is,similar,to,a,tour,guide,.
In,a,sense,the,teacher,is,the,tour,guide,guiding,students,through,a,topic,that,is,hopefully,new,to,them,just,like,a,tour,guide,would,guide,tourists,through,a,new,city,.,If,the,tour,guide,is,crap,the,tourists,lose,out,on,information,they,may,be,interested,in,.
I,can,see,that,being,a,reasonable,metaphor,because,they,guide,and,teach,students,.,They,have,something,new,to,show,and,speak,about,with,students,.
Students,should,be,active,participants,with,their,teacher,.,Tourists,are,often,passive,and,allowing,the,guide,to,do,the,work,without,being,challenged
I,dont,know,if,I,agree,with,this,.,A,tourist,is,someone,who,is,just,following,and,visiting,a,place,.,Students,are,taking,the,lead,in,their,own,venture,.
An,effective,teacher,should,guide,rather,than,dictate,.,This,encourages,students,to,think,on,their,own,.
True,a,tour,guide,has,a,vast,amount,of,knowledge,and,he,is,guiding,students,to,open,their,minds,to,new,experiences,and,ideas,.
It,makes,a,little,sense,and,I,kind,of,agree,with,it,.
I,think,of,a,tour,guide,of,more,like,showing,people,around,a,place,they,have,never,seen,.,College,students,usually,choose,their,major,and,know,what,they,are,getting,into,and,probably,even,have,prior,education,on,the,subject,.
Like,a,tour,guide,teachers,can,talk,and,show,all,they,want,.,Ultimately,its,up,to,the,students,whether,they,pay,attention,.
Tourists,go,somewhere,to,learn,about,different,things,and,tour,guides,show,them,these,things,.,I,think,this,is,a,lot,like,teachers,showing,students,about,the,different,things,and,helping,them,understand,and,learn,about,them,.
This,seems,more,recreational,than,educational,.,Teachers,may,show,new,places,but,the,students,shouldnt,dabble,.
When,you,are,in,a,tour,you,really,dont,know,too,much,.,In,this,way,a,tour,guide,really,is,a,teacher,.
I,would,use,the,term,traveler,.,A,tourist,doesnt,get,beyond,the,surface,.
A,teacher,is,teaching,the,students,things,they,dont,know,about,like,a,tour,guide,shows,people,things,they,have,never,seen,and,tells,them,things,they,have,never,heard,.
I,agree,with,the,metaphor,.,Teachers,are,the,tour,guide,because,they,know,all,of,the,information,that,the,students,want,to,know,and,they,explain,everything,to,them,.,The,teacher,answers,questions,like,a,tour,guide,does,.
Like,a,tour,guide,the,teacher,present,students,with,interesting,and,different,aspects,and,notions,on,the,students,journey,to,being,a,well,rounded,person,.
Tour,guide,shows,the,people,places,and,things,and,describe,things,.,Teachers,do,the,same,thing,but,need,a,practical,use,of,both,.
A,teacher,can,show,the,students,their,own,world,view,through,a,lens,much,like,a,tour,guide,.,I,think,this,is,a,good,metaphor,.
This,analogy,is,okay,.,The,students,are,given,a,new,world,to,explore,and,the,tools,to,explore,it,.,Meanwhile,the,teacher,has,the,means,to,direct,them,so,that,they,see,all,the,important,sites,and,no,one,gets,lost,.,Theres,no,real,incentive,for,the,teacher,to,perform,well,here,though,.,Theyre,not,new,to,this,area,.,Theyve,seen,it,before,and,like,real,life,tour,guides,they,might,have,some,days,where,they,just,dont,care,if,the,tourists,are,impressed,.
It,makes,the,process,of,education,sound,casual,and,unimportant,.,Tourists,are,just,visitors,and,dont,really,take,anything,away,when,they,leave,a,place,.,Students,should,be,dedicated,to,learning,and,plan,for,education,to,become,a,permanent,part,of,who,they,are,.,A,tour,guide,doesnt,need,to,be,much,of,an,expert,or,have,enthusiasm,.
A,tour,guide,takes,those,that,follow,them,through,something,explaining,along,the,way,.,A,teacher,does,the,same,thing,in,the,classroom,.
I,think,that,touring,is,more,of,a,vacation,and,for,not,thinking,too,much,about,anything,.,Teaching,should,be,about,curiosity,and,the,need,to,take,in,as,much,information,as,a,person,can,while,being,interested,the,whole,time,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,tour,guide,because,they,guide,us,through,the,learning,experience,while,the,students,are,taking,a,tour,through,learning,different,things,.
A,tour,guide,who,only,takes,you,places,where,they,like,to,be,as,opposed,to,showing,you,everything,there,is,to,see,.
This,would,apply,more,to,a,geography,professor,.,The,professor,can,show,them,what,the,students,are,interested,in,but,the,students,are,more,involved,in,the,process,instead,of,an,experience,like,a,tourist,usually,gets,.
This,is,too,casual,a,metaphor,thinking,like,the,tourists,are,not,interested,in,more,than,a,superficial,look
It,seemed,a,bit,glib,at,first,but,the,more,I,thought,about,it,the,more,I,realized,that,in,one,class,or,semester,a,teacher,really,cant,do,more,than,show,you,the,sights,.,Its,up,to,the,students,to,decide,how,closely,they,want,to,look,and,if,they,want,to,go,deeper,.
Because,a,tour,guide,can,guide,anywhere,mostly,using,a,pamphlet,and,some,practice,learning,the,area,while,a,teacher,has,mostly,only,their,own,area,of,knowledge,.
This,works,I,think,.,Teachers,show,and,tell,but,how,much,someone,gets,out,of,the,experience,is,up,to,them,.
Guides,show,tourist,around,and,give,them,information,about,where,or,what,they,are,touring,.,Teachers,do,the,same,thing,with,students,by,showing,them,around,.
This,is,actually,not,bad,.,Teachers,point,things,out,.,I,like,it,.
Yes,.,The,tour,guide,tries,their,best,to,cater,to,the,audience,which,is,the,student,body,.,It,is,up,to,the,student,to,decide,whether,to,listen,to,the,tour,guide,or,let,their,minds,wander,similar,to,if,you,are,a,tourist,.
Disagree,.,Tourists,are,passive,consumers,of,shallow,content,learning,just,whats,on,the,placard,or,the,blurbs,of,a,tour,guide,.,A,good,teacher,takes,students,deeper,into,the,subject,matter,.
I,feel,that,the,word,tourist,used,in,regards,to,student,indicates,they,have,a,passive,role,in,their,education,rather,than,learning,to,be,the,tour,guide,themselves,.
The,teacher,shows,the,student,the,way,and,how,to,navigate,the,educational,process,of,learning,a,skill,.,The,teacher,guides,them,through,the,path,of,learning,.
This,simile,reminds,me,of,a,history,teacher,.,A,tour,guide,would,take,you,around,and,show,you,the,most,important,places,and,things,.,A,teacher,does,the,same,whether,it,be,in,history,or,science,math,or,music,.,The,teacher,tour,guide,shows,the,student,tourist,all,of,the,important,elements,of,their,discipline,.
The,teacher,is,head,and,teaches,the,kids,on,how,to,solve,problems,and,be,a,better,person,.,Teachers,are,like,tour,guides,because,they,are,being,looked,upon,to,be,taught,right,and,do,good,in,school,.
This,is,somewhat,true,in,the,sense,that,the,teacher,is,a,guide,showing,the,tourists,around,and,showing,students,what,there,is,to,see,.,It,is,up,to,the,students,what,they,want,to,make,of,it,and,if,they,want,to,explore,it,further
I,think,the,student,has,more,of,an,active,role,in,learning,and,the,idea,of,being,a,tourist,is,very,passive,.
There,is,a,lot,about,a,certain,topic,to,learn,and,the,teacher,knows,it,well,making,them,the,tour,guide,.,The,students,do,not,so,theyre,the,tourists,learning,from,the,more,experienced,individual,.
I,mentioned,this,in,a,previous,response,actually,.,I,completely,agree,the,teacher,is,showing,them,the,importance,of,wherever,they,are,and,the,tourists,have,the,choice,to,either,pay,attention,and,ask,more,or,allow,themselves,to,get,distracted,.,This,captures,university,exactly,in,my,opinion,.
Teachers,guide,students,like,tour,guides,guide,tourists,.
Allan,Bloom,uses,this,metaphor,in,his,classic,The,Closing,of,the,American,Mind,.,One,of,his,students,called,him,the,worlds,greatest,tour,guide,.,In,his,view,the,role,of,the,teacher,is,to,guide,the,student,through,history,to,expose,the,student,to,new,ways,that,are,not,easily,viewable,by,oneself,.,He,uses,Platos,analogy,of,the,cave,as,an,example,.
That,would,imply,the,students,are,only,there,for,a,little,bit,and,that,they,are,just,walking,through,the,area,.
This,metaphor,is,okay,.,A,tour,guide,leads,the,tour,and,shows,the,tourists,things,they,have,not,seen,before,.,This,can,be,similar,to,a,teacher,.
I,dont,really,care,for,this,one,.,Yes,the,tour,guide,has,the,information,and,tourists,want,to,learn,.,I,just,think,its,almost,too,literal,and,I,just,dont,really,care,for,it,.,You,are,not,there,to,sightsee,you,are,there,to,learn,.
College,teachers,show,new,things,to,students,like,a,tour,guide,.,One,difference,is,that,college,teachers,form,stronger,bonds,with,their,students,as,the,term,progresses,.

I,dont,think,this,helps,the,metaphor,at,all,teachers,are,not,guiding,the,students,but,they,are,teaching,them,.
Not,the,best,but,there,is,some,relevancy,as,the,teacher,does,guide,students,through,the,world,of,knowledge,and,shows,them,important,areas,to,study,.
I,kind,of,agree,with,this,because,when,you,go,on,a,tour,you,are,with,someone,who,is,knowledgeable,about,the,area,or,object,you,are,looking,at,.,The,same,with,the,teacher,they,are,the,ones,sharing,their,knowledge,.
I,can,see,how,this,is,a,good,metaphor,.,It,makes,sense,since,teachers,teach,and,students,listen,.,Teachers,need,to,show,the,world,and,students,need,to,learn,it,.
This,is,getting,a,little,closer,to,something,I,would,agree,strongly,with,.,I,like,the,idea,of,this,being,a,journey,of,sorts,with,the,teacher,being,the,learned,one,who,knows,the,terrain,and,the,students,coming,along,for,the,trip,.,Theres,no,requirement,for,the,students,to,be,passive,here,but,they,can,be,if,they,choose,to,be,.,And,the,teacher,knows,not,only,where,theyre,going,but,how,theyll,get,there,and,the,details,along,the,way,.
I,like,this,because,it,indicates,the,teacher,is,guiding,them,through,life,and,showing,them,the,different,scenery,so,they,can,soak,it,all,in,.
This,metaphor,makes,sense,because,a,tour,guide,illustrates,and,enables,tourists,to,see,and,experience,things,that,they,would,not,otherwise,without,their,help,similar,to,how,a,teacher,guides,their,students,to,learn,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,tour,guide,and,the,students,are,like,tourist,because,the,teacher,is,showing,the,students,all,there,is,to,know,about,where,they,are,headed,.
I,somewhat,disagree,because,teachers,go,more,in,depth,on,topics,than,a,tour,guide,would
The,tour,guide,provides,knowledge,of,the,area,and,the,tourists,absorb,that,knowledge,to,know,more,.
A,tour,guide,imparts,tips,and,useful,information,to,tourists,about,a,new,place,and,so,too,does,a,teacher,to,students,.
I,agree,with,this,metaphor,in,the,sense,that,students,follow,the,lead,the,teacher,sets,.,The,students,are,guided,by,the,teacher,.
Not,the,best,but,it,does,have,common,points,.,The,teach,in,this,role,acts,as,a,guide,but,the,students,should,not,be,labeled,as,tourists,.,It,implies,they,are,there,only,to,consume,.,Tourism,does,not,necessarily,mean,that,as,it,could,be,a,learning,experience,but,it,does,sort,of,imply,the,former,.
This,one,to,me,doesnt,make,that,much,sense,.,I,get,what,was,going,for,it,but,I,dont,really,like,the,comparinson,.
I,think,this,metaphor,is,alright,but,not,great,.,Not,even,good,.,It,implies,that,students,are,only,popping,in,for,a,quick,visit,to,knowledge,or,learning,before,they,head,back,home,to,ignorant,bliss,.,And,teachers,are,much,more,than,tour,guides,.,Tour,guides,show,tourists,the,highlights,only,they,dont,get,into,the,nitty,gritty,details,the,rich,culture,behind,the,village,on,the,side,of,the,mountain,overlooking,the,bay,.,They,just,say,And,here,we,have,Peaceful,Village,#,274,.
Tour,guides,show,points,of,interests,just,skimming,the,surface,of,area,.
