A college teacher is usually independent qualified hard working and competitive. He or she has experience in the academic world and has probably published quite a few things in his or her field.,Firstly these are similes not metaphors. Now to my justification Some students are more malleable than others and are more easily influenced by the ideas of professors. Conversely a student may be repulsed if a particular professors beliefs are out of line with the students. The teachers ability to sculpt rather than support a students progress depends on many things personality teaching style and the receptiveness of the student.,A teacher can nurture and help a students ideas flourish and grow. Much like a gardener a teacher can plant seeds of knowledge metaphor and see them through to fruition. This sounds about right to me.,This simile in more appropriate because a coachs job is to teach a skill and students if they are like athletes practice the skill in this case learning about a subject. After all is done the student will have acquired a new skill or set of ideas.,What? I think of an app as something of an add on which can be used at times when needed. This is not my ideal concept of a good teacher. Jeez if my professors had been like apps I could just have stayed home and surfed the web. There would be no interaction.,This idea is more in line with what I believe. A teacher can expose a student to many landscapes of thought and the student is invited to participate.,This puts the professor fully in charge of the game with no input from students except for doing grunt work. I dont like that simile at all. There should be more interaction between parties.,My favorite professors planted ideas and nurtured and fed the students until they flourished and produced their own fruitful ideas.
I think about a trainer. They are like someone training a group of people. They are also a conductor.,Teachers help mold students. However they arent the end all be all.,Students arent plants they are humans.,Teachers do guide students like coaches.,They seem incompatible.,Tour guides do inform but they are more informal.,It is a great metaphor. Teachers lead a ship with many students and sailors.,It sounds so much more meaningful to me.
I consider college professors to be interesting well read unique educated and liberal. They are temporary shepherds of a flock of students.,This metaphor makes total sense as teachers shape their students and mold them into better people.,The teacher tends to the students and helps them grow like a gardener in a garden of plants.,Teachers are less like coaches than some of the other metaphors.,This sounds a bit complicated but it makes sense if you really think about it as each teacher has their own information to impart like a specific app and the students access the information.,I dont like this metaphor because tourists tend to only be temporary visitors to the information,This metaphor isnt totally true as there is not growth or learning aspect to it. Sailors are more just hired hands to a captain.,Plants grow and so do students. I like the idea that teachers help students grow into their full potential.
In our past college life. Her name is Mary she teaches very clearly and talks friendly to her student.,Teacher is like a sculptor and student is like a clay to teach to succeed in our life.,Teacher is like a gardener and student is like a plant to carry about their health.,A teacher is like a coach to teach all the good habits and a student is like an athlete to understand the teachers ideas.,A teacher is like an app to share their talent and good things to their student and student is like the user to understanding their concept.,Teacher is like a tourist guide and student is like a tourist to guide all levels of techniques,Teacher is like a captain of ship the student is like a sailor to handle the problems.,Because I like apps.
Spewing information dull not creative in teaching sit and get very book intelligent and not worldly smart.,If a student wants to be changed the professor is the one to change them. I think professors have a great impact on students.,This is a good metaphor. Students will all grow. By definition learning is growth. Some will learn an enormous amount while others not so much. With good nurturing by the teacher the student will grow stronger faster and healthier.,A teacher is like a coach. The student has a general idea of what to do. The coach is there to refine and make them better.,Do we let college students choose which things they will learn? My college teachers stood in front of us and lectured. Probably the worst way to teach.,A tour guide shows people around. The people can learn as much as they want to with or without the guide.,I agree with the metaphor. But I see the captain as teaching the students how to be the captain. Do students just follow orders?,Everyone can learn. Some learn more than others. The best teachers will bring out the best in students. Those qualities may not be class material but may be more about curiosity love of learning and learning about the world. I am a teacher. I hope my students not only learn the material but they learn to take opportunity persevere and be able to deal successfully with all kinds of people.
Im an elementary school teacher and there is no way I could be a college teacher. College kids can be so lazy!!,Id rather teachers be compared to gardeners or guides rather than sculptors. The verb mold makes me feel as if teachers are forcing their views onto the students which we may sometimes do rather than leading them through to the different answers. This rubbed me the wrong way.,This metaphor would work better for elementary school. While college students are still growing I dont think of college teachers as nurturing as elementary school teachers are.,Coaches are a type of teacher albeit athletic rather than academic. Athletes learn from their coaches and students learn from their teachers.,Students as users have access to teachers. As a store the teachers have a plethora of apps or advice or knowledge which students can use. However teachers arent controlled by students like app stores are controlled by users.,Students are touring through the country of knowledge in whatever subject they are taking. The teachers are the experts hopefully and guide the tourists around.,This metaphor would work if you think of a room like a ship and the journey one of subject knowledge. The teacher is the leader which guides the year and the students learn from this leader.,Coaches are a type of teacher they offer advice they guide they instruct they encourage. Students are academic athletes who must learn from their teachers but when they are out in the field taking a test or working a job they must rely on what they learned from their coach. They are on their own.
Lecturers are professional civil servants who teach and train at universities or colleges of a university or college education.,I agree with that statement. They are a good sculptor a good citizen. Clients are clay because they need to be molded to form their dignity and social status.,,,,,,Because students are the nucleus of the future the mainstay of the country. Should be cared for and trained so this statement is very true for the job of university lecturers.
I think they have a valuable role to play in educating children. They can help prepare them for life and their careers.,In a way yes. You sculpt their learning.,Yes they teach and nurture students minds.,They can nurture athletic ability like they can a mind but kind of different as well.,I think its a silly comparison. Smartphone users choose their apps I dont recall students picking their teachers.,In a way. I think it depends on the subject.,They represent an order. The captain leads the ship.,Because gardeners nurture plants to survive and grow as do teachers. My teachers nurtured our minds helped us along to understand the material.
Professional knowledgeable often have strong political opinions and sometimes cannot keep them to themselves.,In college you are taught methodologies as much as facts. Most people can do these methodologies with training but it takes a good teacher to explain how they work and get people to follow them.,You cannot weed students out because they are disruptive or failing. Nor can you nurture them like a plant. You have to give them the tools they need and let them grow on their own.,Like a coach a teacher at college level has to give students practical advice and push them to be the best they can be. But unlike a coach the class is not necessarily a team and the kind of team spirit you go for in sports is not necessary.,A teacher is not there to give students whatever they want not in the classroom at any case. Nor should students see themselves as consumers. Looking at college as an apprenticeship is more precise.,School isnt there for fun nor is it a presentation of plain facts. And a teacher needs to be actively involved rather than passively showing people stuff. It isnt a good metaphor.,A teacher at the college level has to teach more than facts they have to lead students in a methodology. To that end they have to control the classroom with students being active participants rather than observers.,It describes best what the teacher is and what the students are. The best teachers guided students through their class and if necessary gave them orders and discipline but did not do their work for them.
Someone who has worked very hard to get where they have been. College teachers are typically Democrat.,A teachers teachings will allow students to form into the person that they want to be with the learnings.,Every time the teacher teaches a child they become a plant in their garden of affect.,A teacher gives wisdom to help students become the best that they can be in the field.,A teacher is a place in which the students use their brains to learn what the teachings are.,A teacher shows students the way that they do not have ideas about.,I think that a teacher is the leader but without their students they would have no purpose.,I like this metaphor because it has a more straightforward meaning. It makes sense to people who think more simply.
An older wiser more professional looking person who is highly educated. A person who is engaging in lectures and creative with techniques of teaching.,This one is weird sounding. I suppose because the clay is inanimate and doesnt really have an action itself. You hear people say all the time that the teacher is molding the students but I dont personally like this metaphor. The sculptor is not teaching the clay anything and is not taking care of or nourishing the clay really.,This is another good one. Just like the gardener is caring for and feeding and watching over his plants the college teacher is doing the same for his students.,This one works very very well. The coach is guiding and teaching the athletes and has the same goal as the athletes. The coach is a mentor to them and they all work together toward the same goal.,Again not the best metaphor for this. The app store doesnt always support the users and the users and app store dont always collaborate very well. The app store doesnt really teach the users anything.,This would be the best one so far that I have read here. The tour guide is the brains of the operation and is teaching and showing the tourists about everything. The guide is literally guiding them through the area or whatever it is they are touring and knows what direction to lead them in and how to get there. The college teacher does the same for the students.,This can be applied to a college teacher and the students. I suppose if both are trying to move in the same direction towards the same goal. I dont feel it is the best metaphor for this however.,Again I prefer this one because it appears the most common with the concept. It has the most similarities with what its being compared to.
I think a college teacher is a good person who has to love school and wanted to never leave. They are likely a liberal and have left leaning thoughts but that is not usually a problem.,I dont think that the professors have the responsibility of sculpting students. Students have to accept what they say and agree or disagree with what the professor says.,This is more of something I agree with because there is some chance that a plant will not develop. Like a student that may fail a class even with correct watering.,Yes this is similar because the teacher should lead and the students follow.,No I dont think that students just download an interface with the teachers.,I think that a professor is more than a tour guide. They do indeed have the knowledge but do not just spit out stuff and students listen. They have a deeper understanding of the content.,A teacher is a leader and the students are to follow the leader.,It is more accurate because a plant can sort of make a choice to grow. Like a student can make a choice to accept what the teacher is saying or not.
Intelligent people who have a passion for teaching make solid choices in life. Good with finances for example.,I mean it kind of makes sense but Im not molding myself to be the professor. Im using his knowledge to better myself and go my own way. He may teach things but Im going to implement them my own way.,I guess this one makes sense in that that we as students are growing to become a beautiful smart intelligent plant. I like this one.,I like this line of thought the professors give us the chance to become great athletes so to speak we work hard and carve our own path with their advice and guidance.,It kind of make sense if you consider it from a strictly financial point of view were paying for their service and getting knowledge in return.,I just dont have this metaphor resonating with me at all a tourist just kind of looks around at things and doesnt do much of anything. And a tour guide? Seems a bit demeaning.,This one doesnt resonate with me at all because I dont know if sailors are just like random people on the ship or if they work for the captain or what?,I think it provides a solid reasoning for the fact that students can become amazing people due to the teacher.
Someone who is very knowledgeable and champions education. They enjoy learning and sharing their knowledge with others.,The teacher uses his or her experiences and knowledge to help shape the students minds to get them to better grasp what they are being taught.,The teacher plants the seed into the student and the student grows from there. The teacher continues to mend the garden and the students learn and grow from what they are taught and instructed.,The teacher is like the coach giving knowledge about a subject just like a coach gives tips advice and strategy to athletes.,I can see the comparison but at the same time I do not think it is accurate. The students cannot pick and choose what they want to learn from the teacher.,The teach is bringing them on a journey but I think I only somewhat agree because a tour guide is providing a more passive experience whereas a teacher is usually there to get the subject the knowledge embedded and deeply understood.,The students are not there to help run the ship they are there to gain knowledge so this comparison I do not feel is as good as some of the others. Sailors assist the captain with a lot of the ship work.,I think it fits well with saying that a teacher helps to shape a students mind just as a sculptor shapes the clay. I feel like my college teachers have helped shape me in some ways as how to think about certain subjects or view certain aspects of a subject.
Friendly and caring too. They spend their valuable time in teaching us and also they support us in regard to various terms and have responsibility in developing us to good position.,Of course teachers are sculptor and students are clay because they provide a shape and help us to be in great position so teachers are considered as sculptors.,For plants its necessary to have a gardener because to take care of its growth. So teachers are considered as gardener.,Because they have more responsibilities than us they work for us and also they spend their valuable item with us they sacrifice everything for us so they are considered as metaphor in college.,Because student can make use of everything from the teachers whenever they found something difficult they can approach teachers. So teachers are considered as app store.,Teachers guide on various things and explain it to us clearly so they are considered as tour guides.,Because teachers guide the students to the better way and provide them necessary information on various times. So teachers are considered as captain in the ship.,Because teachers take care of us in many ways and help in growth of ours.
I think about an intelligent person who knows his or her subject but has little common sense or ability to explain his or her thoughts clearly to average individuals.,College professors do everything they can to indoctrinate their students with their views and biases. So they attempt to sculpt the students to think just like them.,Again I think this is somewhat true because a gardner can determine the outcome of his or her plants by taking good care teaching well of the plants or hurting the plants by ignoring them teaching poorly.,College professors dont train their students to think like a coach does to an athlete. They indoctrinate them usually with liberal ideas.,Im not even sure what this metaphor is supposed to mean. But no teachers are not an app store because often students cant choose their own professors like they can choose an app.,I agree with this because a tour guide shows tourists what the guide wants the to see in his or her city. Similarly professors only share the information and studies with their students that they want to.,You have to follow the orders of your professor or captain or else you will suffer the consequences. In the classroom this translates to poor grades.,Once again I think this is most apt because I felt that in the majority of my college courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels the professors were not interested in my thoughts or freedom of thought but wanted to push their political viewpoints down my throat. They wanted to sculpt me in their image.
They are smart but sometimes bad at teaching. Sometimes they spend more time on research than improving their teaching methods.,Not really this implies the teacher is responsible for molding the student. I think it is the students responsibility to learn from the teacher.,Yes every lecture the teacher is showering the little growing students with knowledge so they can grow as a person.,Yes the coach gives the students advice and motivates them to perform better in the world.,Yes the app store has all the apps and the teacher has all the knowledge. It is up for the student to download that knowledge.,Yes the teachers are describing and explaining topics that they are experts on while the students are learning.,The teacher definitely is the leader in the classroom and the students follow him or her on a journey. But a captain is supposed to have his sailors best interest at heart. Sometimes teachers dont.,Because there are metaphors about growing involved. It is a very good imagery.
A professor someone who is an expert in their industry who likes working with young people. It is a less involved job than a high school teacher and mostly requires giving lectures and assigning work for the students to do.,The teacher is molding the students into better people more educated people about their subject. But it is also better suited for a parent to be the molder than a teacher.,This makes sense because the teachers are providing knowledge which is like water and the students are supposed to absorb it.,This is a fairly accurate metaphor. A coach is to athletes what a teacher is to university students.,That doesnt make sense to me. Maybe a college could be like an app store and students can choose courses from that but it doesnt make sense for professors to be an app store.,This makes sense because the teachers are leading the tour and passing along information to the tour participants.,This could work. Like the teachers are in charge of the ship they are charting the course of the education but students have to do the hard work to make the course happen.,I think that this makes sense because the teacher is guiding the learning but the students have to do the actual work to make the class work.
Underpaid underappreciated. Your response must be at least 100 characters. Dude tell me that at the beginning. They are underpaid. They need to be paid more for the important job that they do. They are also underappreciated.,Eh. I guess that this one is a little ok. But you cant shape people that much its more like the people are almost like wood. Sure you can try to do a bit but its not going to change much.,Sure I agree a little with this one. Its kind of like the statue one.,No. Coaches dont do that much and do not affect people in the way that a teacher does.,,No. Teachers actually teach people the things that they need to learn not just show things and shuffle along.,Nah. Sailors can always mutiny and take over. Students cant do that to a teacher.,Teachers just do their best. Some people listen and get something some do not. And some teachers are good at what they do and others are just getting a paycheck and their name on papers.
Arrogant and above students. Sometimes caring and goes the extra mile to be thoughtful. Doing a job.,A teacher creates a person by the way they teach.,A student flourishes with the proper teaching.,,,Students need to be led the way and the proper guide shows them the way.,,
College teachers are knowledgeable in their field. College teachers should always engage their students in higher level thinking.,I like this metaphor because a good professor can engage their students and mold them per se by providing engaging learning opportunities which enhance and challenge their students.,A teacher is the person responsible for planting seeds of knowledge into their students. Just like a good gardener the teacher will continue to provide aspects such as encouragement and learning materials to prepare students for a lifetime of learning.,Although a college teacher is responsible for teaching their students adult students should still have some sense of being able to speak freely and openly about certain concepts and factors being presented.,In many ways a student can hold the key to knowledge in their hands so to speak. If the teacher is the app then it is up to the student to access the knowledge from the teacher in order to empower the student.,Teachers are able to provide a variety of learning opportunities in some cases involving various subject matters particularly in elementary school settings. Therefore the learning becomes multifaceted.,In many ways this metaphor would mean that the professor is in charge of guiding the students during a course and the students responsibility would be to basically take directions. There may not be much room for individuality.,I prefer this metaphor because during my years of college I could see where my professors were the apps. Ive taken several classes over the years and just like an app Ive been able to use the information my professors have offered to extend my knowledge in the subject matters for each specific major.
A college teacher could be like a solar wind. It flashes a bright light to those who see it in an instant but only temporarily.,I think that this is a perfect example because students are basically there to learn. They are at the teachers whims.,I think it is obvious that this metaphor works. The teacher is growing the students mind by nourishing it with more information and knowledge. That is good information and good knowledge.,I dont think that this is a great metaphor but it technically works. A teacher guides the students like a coach guides athletes.,I disagree with this because I dont think that it makes sense. This is because the thing thats controlling the app is the operating system of the software. I think a much better metaphor is that the teacher is the operating system and the students are the app. The classroom can even be the smartphone.,I think that this metaphor works. This is because a teacher guides the students throughout life and the ride is only temporary.,I think this technically works because a teacher is in a leadership role. However the main goal of a teacher is to develop their students not put them to work.,I prefer this metaphor because it accurately shows that a teacher is responsible for shaping the students while in the classroom. Sure the students are responsible for other things but the teacher is responsible for shaping the students initially.
A person that can be relied upon for intelligence and who could be asked to answer important questions that might come up in the course of events.,It occurs to me that the role of the teacher is not to mold the student so much as that would be more like what a mentor would do. A teacher is a bit more hands off than that.,This makes a little bit more sense metaphorically compared to the other examples regarding technology or sports. I can see a natural growth analogy here.,This explanation also does not quite actually fit the reality of what is going on in a class setting and I think that most students do not consider their teacher to be like a coach.,I think that using a technological metaphor of this sort is not a great fit for the kind of actual experience that students and teachers engaged with each other in a school setting would have.,I dont feel like the idea of the teacher as a tour guide is accurate at all and the students as tourists just doesnt fit or make much sense even.,I do not think that this is an appropriate way to consider the classroom experience and there is far less of a bond between students than that of shipmates.,The plants have to find their own way to grow up towards the sun and receive nourishment but the teacher can help along the way by providing extra resources or insight in order to facilitate that growth. That seems like a good way of thinking about the classroom experience.
A wise parent imparting life lessons to adored children and who gives them comfort that will last forever. It truly will.,Minds are empty of the subject matter and ready to be shaped.,Yes there is a lot of growth.,Teachers do motivate but there is more to it.,,They show students around the block a few times.,Yes teachers lead and sailors or students follow.,its true that teachers show students around and give them a peek at a lot of things.
When I think of a teacher I get two images that come to my mind. I can picture a young blonde taching a classroom of young ones. I also see an older man with the usual brown khakis and green vest grey haired lecturing in a room full of college students.,Dont get caught putting your hands on the students.,I could agree with that. the teacher is feeding their brains but up to them to eat.,I guess if their college class is sports,,youre not going anywhere physically I guess.,Theres not too much about sailing on the open sea that matches up with teaching.,You can relate teaching young minds pretty well to watering and feeding growing plants.
A person who is educated not just in facts but in life. Someone who is ready to mold the mind of adults.,I would deem this correct as teachers do mold students. They shape the minds and thoughts of their pupils.,I think this is a very accurate description as a teacher must tend the students minds much like plants. The gardener does all they can to guide the plants in the right direction but it is ultimately on them to grow.,I also agree with this metaphor as the teacher much like a coach provides a game plan for success. They are guides for the students minds instead of their bodies.,I disagree with this metaphor because teachers are not really like app stores. Students cannot choose teachers like apps.,A teacher does show things to students. They guide them to knowledge and the student must absorb it.,I agree because teachers do guide the course for students. They lead the way but the students must steer.,I prefer this metaphor because I feel it most accurately describes the relationship between teachers and students. I feel this metaphor shows exactly how they relate to each other and interact.
Eccentric people that love their jobs but maybe arent the best at portraying information. Mainly breaking down information to explain it,I think this is true. As long as the students are willing to be sculpted but even the most stubborn student will be sculpted a little bit even if it is unwillingly.,Again the students as plants have to agree to grow in order for this to work out.,This suggests that the students all want to be part of the team but that is not true. Especially in general education classes that are required.,College teachers know a lot of things and there is no way they can cover everything in class that they know. But if you take the time to go to their office hours and talk to them you can find out so much more.,Taking a college class is like visiting a place you have never been before and the class covers a lot that you may or may not remember.,This suggests the students do everything the teacher says which could not be further from the truth though some students do.,Its modern and reflects my philosophy. I can imagine the metaphor really well.
An educated person who has the skillset to teach a tougher subject to a higher level classroom. A college teacher has to do more research than a typical grade school teacher and has more freedom to their classes.,The teacher sculpts the students and helps them in their educational journeys and to be successful in their studies as a sculptor sculpts clay into something better and more interesting than a block of clay.,A teacher is like the gardener who plants the educational seeds into the students as flowers would in a garden and helps them to grow to their full potential as learners.,Teachers are to students as like coaches are to athletes. They help guide them in their educational path and help them to succeed in their studies as coaches do for sports.,This one really doesnt make sense. An app doesnt really teach the person using it the person using it really is the one who is in control of the app and tells the app how to work and what to do.,The teacher guides the students in their educational journeys and the students are like the tourists on the tour and looking forward for their education and in their studies to learn more.,The teacher is like a captain guiding the students and driving their ship and the students are like the sailors navigating the educational waters with the teacher as their guide.,I just like what it says. The teacher plants the seeds and helps the students grow in their college journeys.
A few of my most memorable teachers reminded me of my dad. They were hard no nonsense strictly business guys but they pushed me to study harder ask questions and engage more. And when I succeeded that pat on the back or well done was so worth it.,Again I can agree with this metaphor. The sculptor will guide the clay along the wheel much as it is the responsibility of the teacher to guide their students on the wheel of learning. What begins as a crude interest can be molded and shaped into an accomplished polished mastery of the material.,I can see how this could be used as a metaphor although I like the ship captain one better. The teacher can most definitely be compared to a gardener as it is his or her responsibility to plant that seed of learning bring the material to life and nourish that curiosity into a sturdy mastery of the material.,A teacher could be like a coach. A coach and teacher are one and the same both pushing their students to achieve the highest performance possible and teaching them that if they work hard enough they will not only accomplish their goals but surpass them.,Im not sure I make the connection with this metaphor other than the students are in the same room as the teacher.,I dont think this is a very strong metaphor but still applicable as it is a tour guides job to gather his tourists and educate them about the world around them.,The captain is responsible for his ship class and that ship isnt going anywhere if you havent educated your sailors. A teacher should be leading that class. He or she should be guiding students by making sure they are covering the assigned material in class giving an opportunity to ask questions and helping find the answers. It is a journey that the teacher and students are both embarking on. By giving your students the tools they need to succeed and leading them you will help them reach beyond their goals.,My teachers were much like captains. They oversaw their classrooms and commanded respect. You did not goof off in those classes. It was their job to educate you on the material and get you to your destination which was a passing grade for that class. If you followed the command of your leader you would arrive at that destination.
I must prepare information for the debate to get the highest grade this quarter with my university professor.,The teachers are the ones who teach the students in their course that is they give the information and the students are molded to this.,I agree since the professors are the ones who sow information so that they flower professionals.,Yes it is like that since the coach guides the athletes and the teacher their students.,Because students need the information that teachers possess the same thing happens with a telephone and its applications.,I totally agree since the teacher is the one who gives the walk in terms of the profession.,I partially agree since the teacher is the one in charge in the classroom and without the students he would not have to do the same goes for a captain and his sailors.,Because the professor has already gone through this university experience and he guides us.
A person who knows the subject matter and is not just reading out of an assigned textbook. They help students connect the dots and assign homework that requires effort and makes one think rather than assigning busy work.,Students are impressionable and need to be guided into shape. Teachers play a significant hand in molding the students into responsible intelligent adults.,The teacher knows how the plants need to grow in order to be strong and fully developed. Students rely on the teacher for information and support just like plants rely on the gardener for care and support.,I can see why some would like this but atheletes get paid to play whether through salaries or scholarships. Most students are not paid to be in class.,The teacher is the store that all the users go to to get information and assignments. The students also have to pay the app store for its time.,Teachers should know the material and be able to teach it. They are the guide for the students who are just tourists until they are there long enough that they learn the information to become guides themselves.,Once again sailors get paid to be on ships. Students do not follow orders from the teacher becasue they are paid. And the teacher is unlike a captain. A captain is responsible for the well being of the sailors under his command. If a student is failing a class it is not up to the teacher to make sure they do the work.,Becasue tour guides are paid to teach and tourists pay to be able to see and learn. Once someone lives in a tourist area for a while they learn enough to be able to become the tour guide themselves. Teachers tell the students what they need to know until they learn enough to go tell someone else and use what they learned.
A professor who is knowledgeable in a great deal of things but specifically in the area that he or she is teaching. Someone who is down to earth and can relate to people in general.,Sort of. Yes students can be molded into what their teacher shares and offers but this is only one piece of the many factors that will decide how the student grows. I agree in theory but this metaphor is loosely stated.,This is a good metaphor. It implies that the teacher is planting seeds of knowledge in his students and can nurture and watch them grow.,This applies for the most part. An athlete grows under the direction of a good coach just as students grow from the knowledge and nurturing received from their teacher.,I suppose it could be considered true but in reality a college teacher is more specified to one particular theme if you will rather than teaching about everything which is what this metaphor implies.,Again I agree. A teacher is there to show students things they have never considered before. Not just regarding the tangible but also in things that are not tangible such as knowledge.,Sort of. However this is loosely stated. A captain is less interested in teaching than he is involved in making sure that the sailors are doing their job. Big difference.,I like this one because to me it is the most accurate depiction of the teacher student relationship. I had a close relationship with several of my teachers and when I graduated I felt that they had a sense of pride that they enjoyed my college journey as much as I did.
Too many students make the mistake of sticking with their high school study methods. Most university exams will push your critical thinking and application skills. While memorization may be a component of your tests dont rely on that method alone. Certainly youll be required to memorize facts. However believe it or not most professors expect that youll actually follow the objectives for each chapter and lecture. Find out what those objectives are and know them by practicing them.,It means that the student doesnt know any things about the outside world. Teacher teaches all the lessons in order to survive the world and also he teaches us about the upcoming technologies and also the teacher uses us to learn many good things.,Within a single roof they will teach lesson for so many students and also they will grasp all the students and when there is any mistake he will have the talent to find out easily.,When the coach is perfect we can be able to run in the race and also we can be able to put hard work according to it.,It is useful for us when there is clear and abstract information then only we will be able to analyze it. Without any proper data we cannot be able to observe anything.,Teacher tell us how to survive in the outside world and also give some tips and guts and they encourage us to pick out our talents and also they boost up in order that you can be able to do this I will be there for your support.,When the teacher is perfect only we can able to learn so many things and also he guides us to do so many things they were like a pathway in our life to teach us so many new things.,My teacher teaches us so many things in order to create a good pathway to me and I will be so thankful to my teacher and also teaches and when I did any mistake he teaches me that you should not do like this.
Older and very educated. Someone who has had many years experience with teaching handling people and life in general.,It makes sense because the teacher is sculpting the student into the form that they want them to be through teaching.,I see how this makes sense because a gardener takes care of his plants to help them grow into the best of what they can be much like a teacher with their students.,I can see how its true mostly. The coach is the person who trains the athletes to be better at what they do mentally and physically. The difference is it is for a game and a team.,I dont really see the connection on this one. A smartphone user would search through the app store and pick and choose what they decide to read or use where as a teacher teaches you what they have planned and you listen and take notes.,I agree with this for the most part. A tour guide educates tourists about the area and what they are exploring. And the tourists are there to learn about that particular subject. Just like in college where you choose to learn about a subject and the teacher is there to educate.,I feel like a captain on a ship is a leader with a goal and purpose for himself or his company and the crew is just workers taking commands and doing their job that they already know how to do. They are not learning from the captain or using the experience to better themselves for the next step in life.,It just sounds the most fitting. As a student you are fresh and growing and learning. If there teacher does his job right the student will blossom into a full grown flower AKA someone who is mature educated and ready.
I think about a teacher who doesnt really put a lot of effort into their curriculum. Most of my teachers have been laid back to the point that they just didnt really care much about what happens in regards to their students education.,A teacher can highly influence a young minds thoughts and perceptions. They cant necessarily turn students into entirely different people but they can offer insightful opinions and advice.,I think that although the college teachers I have had have been very lazy in terms of schoolwork they do teach us a lot about life. They are influential people that we see on a regular basis who have a lot of insight into adult life so to speak.,Teachers want you to succeed for the most part. They are supposed to be our motivators and want us to do well.,I dont really think this is a good analogy but it gets the point across. Teachers are willing to share their information with us as long as we ask for the most part.,A teacher is supposed to teach us about the unknown. We are tourists in an unfamiliar location and they are the guides with adequate knowledge about our surroundings.,The teacher is meant to help us work together and learn collaboratively. Ive heard this metaphor many times before and I agree with it to an extent.,I think that these professors are a lot more experienced in many aspects. They offer us guidance in terms of both education and our private lives.
when I think about college teachers I think about the ones that I dealt with. I felt on equal playing ground with them. It was not like high school where I felt the teacher was above me. I also felt that my teacher made me think. I think they challenge and work to bring out my best potential. they will call you out if they feel you can do better.,I think that the teacher is the one with the knowledge in a classroom. The student is going to this class to learn what the teacher already knows. The teacher has to decide how to present this knowledge to the students. they have the knowledge and are giving it away to the students. How they choose to give this knowledge away is how they are molding the students like clay. They are providing the knowledge they already know and they are making the students smarter and getting them one step closer to where they want to be.,I do believe teachers are like gardeners. They chose how to mold the information in the student just as a gardener choses how to help the plant grow. They can use a certain fertilizer make sure it is watered at certain times. The teacher is able to grow the student and help them become stronger and smarter on the particular subject.,I think as an athlete you already know how to play the game and the coach is there to just guide your skills and make you better. As a teacher many times you are going in with no knowledge on a subject. I think these two things are totally different. I do not see a teacher as a coach.,I somewhat agree with this. We as students are the smartphones users. We know the phone has many apps that can give us knowledge and provide us with information that we do not know just like a teacher. As a student we have the control on if we decide to use the apps provided to us. The teacher has the information like the app and we have to smartphone which if the ability to open that app and listen and gain more knowledge.,Many of these statements are pretty much coming down to the same thing. The teacher is the tour guide. They already know their way around this specific subject. They are guiding the students in this subject and helping them learn and understand what is around them.,I actually disagree with this one. I stated earlier that to me when you reach college you are more on an equal playing ground. Maybe it is because I was older when I chose to attend college but I did not feel as if they were in charge. I felt that even though they had knowledge on the subject there was never a relationship that they were above me as the leader and I was the follower like a captain and sailors.,Because I believe a sculptor sees the potential in the clay and can see in their mind what they want to create with it. It is not a metaphor where someone is greater than another. This metaphor explains that there is a person that sees the greatness and wants to bring it out. In the metaphor it is the clay and as a teacher it is the student.
Academic white sweater. They like it when students take an interest in what they teach. They want students to be mature and not treat college like a continuation of high school. They thought teaching would be a more respected position.,I dont see teachers as shaping the students into what they want but its more of a giving of knowledge arrangement and the students can make of the information what they will rather than just becoming a product of what the teacher says.,A teacher provides mental nourishment to the minds of the students like plants tended by a gardener.,Athletics doesnt make sense in this educational situation. I would not relate the two.,This is an inhuman comparison. I do not compare living things to appliances or technological devices so this metaphor is offensive to me and not one that I would apply to this situation.,Students dont have all the knowledge about a subject and the teacher is like a guide in that they can inform the students about the subject at hand. Students are often stupid like tourists as well floundering about with no idea what is going on.,Basically students are not experts and the they need a leader like a college teacher to show them and give them the knowledge they need. Like a captain and sailors there is only one captain and many crew like a teacher and students relationship.,It is the most living and vital of the metaphors. I also like the mental imagery it generates. I am a gardener too so I get it.
What comes to my mind when I think about the term college teacher is a person who teaches college at the community college.,This analogy sort of fits a sculptor takes something thats why I turn it into something refined. Its kind of the same thing with the college teacher they have these kids with blank slates and they tried to fill them with knowledge.,A gardener cares for and helps his plants to grow. A teacher does the same thing with his or her students. They come in with different ideas and values and learn new things and as a consequence inevitably grow.,This is one I can definitely wrap my mind around the teacher is like the coach of the classroom of students and all of them together can be seen as a team trying to reach a common goal.,I dont see how this analogy works in the situation of a college teacher and his students. I guess Im too old to get this one. To me it doesnt make any sense to.,The teacher needs to lead them guide them and show them different things that they have never experienced before. In this way the teacher is similar to a tour guide.,The teacher can be seen as the leader of the college classroom and the students as the followers. In this way they are similar to a captain and his crew of sailors.,I grew up playing sports so that metaphor or analogy makes more sense to me than the other ones do.
Someone who has a great deal of knowledge and is interested in the success of their students. The best professors Ive had have been very well versed in the topic they teach but also expect a high level of effort from their students. A teacher who coddles students too much or is too lenient on his or her students is generally not a great teacher.,Students are there to absorb information taught to them by the professor so I think comparing them to an artist and a work of art is a fair comparison. Just like the artist wont be successful if their work is garbage a professor should be judged on the success of his or her students. The students need the teacher to teach them in order to grow and mature. Sometimes a great teacher can change a students life and or or career path.,A teacher provides the resources and information for students to grow as educators. Especially at the entry level college classes are more than just absorbing information and vomiting it back to the professor in paper or exam form. The best teachers help students become successful learners and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed rather than simply feeding them the answers.,Coaches are there to encourage players but also help them make the best decisions and are there for tough love when its needed. Too many college students think they can simply make up grades with extra credit and that shouldnt be the case. Just like an athlete is to blame if they perform poorly on the field a student is to blame if their grades arent up to expectations.,This makes it sound like the students can pick and choose what is important to them which shouldnt be the case when it comes to an education. Professors should be resourceful and knowledgeable not just there for students to take advantage of.,In a sense the teacher is the tour guide guiding students through a topic that is hopefully new to them just like a tour guide would guide tourists through a new city. If the tour guide is crap the tourists lose out on information they may be interested in.,Calling the teacher the captain and students the sailors makes it seem more like the professor is in charge and the students are simply yes men or women who are to follow the professors every command. I dont think a good classroom environment works like this.,It represents the good professors Ive had so far in my college education. A good professor nurtures a student and helps him or her succeed without coddling it or simply letting it slide by. I think the imagery of a plant represents a students growth well and shows that the gardener simply cant grow something without the plant and the plant cant grow without the gardener. Its a partnership that represents success for both parties.
I think about them being very liberal and opinionated. They mean well but they are going to be paid no matter what. They work for a private institution where the students pay to be there unlike a public school where tax dollars pay them.,I dont completely agree with this metaphor because it implies that students dont think for themselves. College students are probably one of the most opinionated types of people. A teacher doesnt mold their minds but adds to it.,I agree with this because it means that teachers plant ideas into their heads and then the students use that information to grow. Whether or not they agree with the info they still have that information in their minds.,This is probably the most direct metaphor. A teacher coaches students and directs them what they need to do. They dont always follow exactly what they say because they have a mind of their own and control what they think.,This makes sense because the teacher is providing students with a service with information. They offer many things to students and its up to students what they take in and decide to remember and learn from.,I can see that being a reasonable metaphor because they guide and teach students. They have something new to show and speak about with students.,This is a decent metaphor. A teacher is kind of like a boss to students because they have control over students in things like homework and tests. They are an authority figure because they have control over what students do in the classroom.,I think that teachers are there to help students learn and grow. When you are done with a class you will always know something more than you knew before and so your knowledge grows like a plant.
An intellectual person. At best he or she is inspiring and dedicated to education and at worst can be condescending and aloof.,Students come to college hoping to learn and professors have the duty to challenge and educate them.,Teachers help students grow by giving them the tools and support to achieve. This is like a plant with a gardener.,Teachers are supposed to guide students to reach their full potential. They should give students exercises and a structured environment to grow.,This implies a consumer business transaction and also supposes the teacher as the hub for all information and access.,Students should be active participants with their teacher. Tourists are often passive and allowing the guide to do the work without being challenged,Teachers are more like leaders rather than captains. Its up to them to steward students but not to be rigid authority figures.,Plants improve with the guidance of a a gardener but can succeed on their own in the right conditions. Great college teachers can take weak students and make them great successes.
Intelligent intellectual confident outgoing creative demanding strong stubborn competent and willing to help others succeed.,I can agree somewhat with this. The teacher is sculpting our minds to be the person we are meant to be. We start off with the unknown but then our minds can turn into something amazing.,The teacher is helping us all grow as individuals in this huge world we live in. We are learning and becoming our own persons.,A teacher is definitely like a coach. They are supporting teaching helping and coaching us to learn and grown as people. We are growing our minds!,I am a little torn on this one. I dont find that we are using the teacher like a game. I feel like maybe we are going along with the teacher and learning not playing.,I dont know if I agree with this. A tourist is someone who is just following and visiting a place. Students are taking the lead in their own venture.,A teacher is like the main character who helps their students to succeed and become teachers themselves. We learn from the teacher as their students. The teacher is like our destination in the ocean.,I feel that a teacher is part of the whole process and not just the leader as like in a garden. We are growing and learning because of the teachers guidance knowledge and support. The teacher was one of us before and now they are helping our minds grow into our own flowers.
A college teacher should be knowledgeable about his or her area of expertise and should facilitate discussions rather than force feed information.,Teachers have the power to mold their students as they see fit.,Teachers supply the tools that teach students to think and helps them to grow intellectually.,Teachers offer knowledge guidance and direction to train students to become more effective learners.,Teachers encourage students to ask questions and make good use of their knowledge and expertise.,An effective teacher should guide rather than dictate. This encourages students to think on their own.,Teachers should steer students minds in the direction of passion and curiosity.,Gardeners supply water and some tender loving care and let nature students take care of the rest.
I believe a level of prestige comes to the position and I do admire the work they do. I feel a college teacher is a highly stressful job but can be rewarding.,Students have open minds and are ready to absorb the knowledge given to them so I definitely agree. Clay is nothing without a sculptor students cannot absorb knowledge without a guide.,A student can only grow when somebody is tending to those needs so this is a good example.,A coach I feel is more of a mentor and I do not see this as a good comparison. Yes coaches can teach but athletics center on a more physical approach or exercise than a full on teacher.,I agree because students are accessing information and expanding their knowledge. It is something you can do with an app so this is a good comparison.,True a tour guide has a vast amount of knowledge and he is guiding students to open their minds to new experiences and ideas.,I feel using the metaphor there is no captain you should work together to all achieve a similar goal. There are leaders but nobody should be held in higher regard to the contributions of others.,I prefer this one over the others perhaps because it is more current or modern to technology today and it fits for my educational experience. Most of the engineering professors that I worked with did not help as much and were more interested in just getting through the lecture and making their money. It was rare for a professor to care at a university versus when I went to community college so my experience has me a bit more detached and thinking this way. An app can guide you as it what they want you to learn or study for exams but it was more up to me to figure it out with other students and interpret their ideas. The teacher assistants were definitely more helpful than the instructors from my experience.
Very professional and committed to teaching. Someone who is passionate about what they do and doing the very best they can.,That makes a lot of sense a teacher teaches the students and sculpts them into educated humans.,That makes a lot of sense and I really understand where they are going with this.,I kind of agree with this. The teacher and a coach teaches and cares and wants to be sure they do there best to succeed as well.,I dont think that at all an app store is just information sitting there and a teacher teaches you stuff.,It makes a little sense and I kind of agree with it.,A captain is just like a boss and an overseer I dont think that is all the teachers do. I get the concept but I dont agree with it.,I just think it makes more sense than the others. That the teacher is the sculptor doing what they will to teach you and mold you into a good person they are like the sculptor.
I think of a laid back person who is passionate about what they do. They come to class in jeans or other laid back clothes but really understand what they are teaching and want to inspire the students.,The college teacher is molding the students. They are preparing them for their future career and giving them the structure they need to accomplish that.,The teacher is giving the students what they need to grow as a person and grow into their future careers.,I could see professor or student being very similar to the coach or athlete relationship. The athlete or student already has some experience in what they are doing but they need more guidance to learn more about the subject or sport.,This metaphor implies the students are using the teacher. Also it implies that the students arent really learning anything theyre just using a resource. I dont think either of those statements are true.,I think of a tour guide of more like showing people around a place they have never seen. College students usually choose their major and know what they are getting into and probably even have prior education on the subject.,I think this statement implies that the students are simply following orders and not really learning anything new. I dont think thats true at all. In my experience a college classroom is more of a collaborative experience between teacher and student.,I prefer this metaphor because of how I phrased it earlier. The athlete or student is a novice or beginner in their sport or major and the coach or teacher is there to guide them to learn more about their sport or major. From my experience classrooms were not always about taking tests and looking at a teacher perform a lecture. It was a very collaborative experience and discussion was encouraged.
I think of someone whos probably an adjunct professor and is underpaid. I think this person deserves better in life and should be more respected for the service he or she is providing for the community.,Clay will allow anyone to sculpt it. Students are not like that. Some are simply not receptive to the sculpting.,Teachers do not have the level of control and responsibility that gardeners have over plants when talking about students. Theres not that much they can do if students dont care.,This is true to some extent except most athletes are self selected by their desire to be on the team and they want to perform well. Thats not always the same with students.,This is just a really poor metaphor all around. Aside from the interaction theres very little to latch on to as a metaphor.,Like a tour guide teachers can talk and show all they want. Ultimately its up to the students whether they pay attention.,Captains have the moral and legal authority to order sailors around and to punish them to bring them into compliance. Teachers lack these things and bad grades are hardly punishment for a student who simply doesnt care.,I think its the most accurate portrayal of the student teacher relationship and the limitations within based on my own experiences.
I think of someone who is very smart. I think of someone who is serious and who likes to learn. I think of someone who is very dignified. They are also very calm. They like to speak. They are confident and dont mind talking to a lot of people. They enjoy teaching others.,I think that is very true. The teacher can really impart a lot to the student and influence them in many ways. It is not completely true because people come with their own sets of characteristics that cannot be changed but to an extent it is true.,I think this is pretty true because students have the opportunity to grow in a class. A teacher can cultivate them and help them learn and develop into something bigger and stronger.,I think this is true in the aspect that teachers are supposed to show students what to do and teach them how to do it. They are also supposed to motivate them so that they do their very best just like coaches.,This doesnt really make a whole lot of sense to me. I guess the only thing is that an app store has lot of things and the smartphone user can take from it. Still it seems to be a pretty bad metaphor.,Tourists go somewhere to learn about different things and tour guides show them these things. I think this is a lot like teachers showing students about the different things and helping them understand and learn about them.,This is a little true in that the captain is in charge of the sailors. However it is mostly wrong because a captain isnt really teaching the sailors anything or trying to help them but instead the sailors are just working.,I think it shows how students can grow and develop in the class. It shows how they will get better and how the teacher can help them grow but doesnt really make them just helps them get to their potential.
I think of people who are busy with their own fields of study. I think of piles of paper on their desks.,The teacher molds students and shows them new shapes. Students are raw materials to be shaped and guided.,The teacher tends to the students and helps them grow with daily care. The teacher provides an environment for growth.,The teacher urges students to be their best. The teacher urges students to practice regularly. The teacher suggests drinking water.,This metaphor doesnt make any sense at all. Students arent phones and a teacher is nothing like a store.,This seems more recreational than educational. Teachers may show new places but the students shouldnt dabble.,The teacher steers the ship. The students are mere workers and follow orders. That is all I believe.,Teachers show students the way and the students follow. Practice makes perfect and a good teacher will demonstrate this.
Smart and willing to teach. They have a good personality and are approachable. They are respectable and care about teaching us students.,Before we entered the class we didnt know anything about the subject. We were just an unfinished block of clay. As we learned we were able to carve out pieces of the block and reveal what is hidden in it. At the end of the class it actually looks like something and has been formed.,As a teacher I am sure that you see growth in students. In this way I can see how teaching provides food for us plants so we can grow.,Coaches are just there to make sure we are doing things properly. We pretty much already know what we are doing they are just there to tweak things.,If a teacher is like an app and we are the user we are not really learning the information. We are just using it instead.,When you are in a tour you really dont know too much. In this way a tour guide really is a teacher.,I dont think of teachers as captains. They are not my boss. I do take orders from them but they are there to teach me not order me around.,Because you start off the beginning of the class not knowing anything really and when you are done with it you have knowledge. The block of clay has now turned into something else.
I think about me because Im a university lecturer. I think about mentoring students and opening minds.,I wouldnt say clay. I would say students are like wood. They are rough and unformed but are solid. They have strong but undefined form.,The parents are the gardeners. Teachers are the florist or the cook.,This is getting closer. A coach imparts wisdom and keeps the team on track. Thats a lot of what teaching is.,,I would use the term traveler. A tourist doesnt get beyond the surface.,This is so totally wrong. The students dont work under the teacher.,This is the closest. It still lacks nuance. A teacher imparts wisdom and pushes students towards a goal. However a teacher in the humanities me gives the student the tools necessary to run their own race in their own way.
A college teacher is like a boss. He cant hold your hand through everything instead he is a guide to your learning.,A teacher uses the students that are like a ball of clay and molds them into a worker. He teaches them what they need to know in order to be a functioning human being.,This is just like the sculptor metaphor. These are getting to be redundant. The teacher waters the students with knowledge and they grow.,This is an obvious one. Sometimes teacher are coaches too. They are essentially doing the same things when they teach and coach and that is to get kids to learn something.,I kind of get the metaphor but I am not sure it fits well. You dont go to a teacher and search for things that teacher shows you things you need to know.,A teacher is teaching the students things they dont know about like a tour guide shows people things they have never seen and tells them things they have never heard.,The teacher is is like the captain because he is in charge of his students and and he leads them. The students are there to learn from the teach just like sailors learn form the captain.,It is the one with the most similarity.
I think of college teachers as professional researchers. They teach others in their spare time but their real job is to run experiments and make discoveries.,I do not think that metaphor is accurate because in college students are more likely to learn from themselves than they are from their professor. When I was in college I stopped paying attention to my teachers after my freshman year. I was still able to finish school with above a 3.0 GPA.,I do not agree with this metaphor because teachers do not usually provide the students with everything that they need to grow in their own career.,I do not think teachers and students are like coaches and athletes. Coaches provide the plan and guide their athletes with the tools necessary to succeed.,I agree with the metaphor. Teachers are like the app store meaning that they provide students with an opportunity to grow and become more than what they are. They supply the environment for which you learn and determine how much you will actually learn in school.,I agree with the metaphor. Teachers are the tour guide because they know all of the information that the students want to know and they explain everything to them. The teacher answers questions like a tour guide does.,I agree with the metaphor. Teachers lead the students by telling them what they need to learn to become successful in the career of their choice. Students are like sailors because they follow the captains order.,I prefer this metaphor because this is the most accurate metaphor of the teacher and student relationship. Teachers provide the platform and it is up to students to meet that guideline.
Someone who is very smart and a bit introverted. They like to do research and they enjoy reading books.,A teacher should not sculpt the student to be what they want the student to be. The teacher should encourage the students curiosity and help them when they need help.,A gardener is someone that shapes a garden to their liking. A teacher is someone that helps students achieve their independence.,A teacher is someone that guides a student not command them. This is what a coach does. Instead the teacher should serve as a gentle and understanding guide and the student should be free to choose what they want to do.,I think that a teacher is more like a guide that present students with a variety of options to choose from. The teacher provides the student with the knowledge so that the student makes an informed decision.,Like a tour guide the teacher present students with interesting and different aspects and notions on the students journey to being a well rounded person.,A teacher is more like a guide that helps people get to where they need or want to go. A captain of a ship determines the destination and the sailors follow. That is not what a teacher should do for their students.,This is the metaphor that best encompasses the student or teacher relationship. It is a metaphor that implies that the student still have independence and that they can see a variety of interesting things.
Someone that likes to hear themselves speak a lot. Sometimes a little arrogant because they know that they are smarter than you and like to show it.,The student is uninformed when they start a class. A lump of clay. the teacher molds the student with knowledge to form a knowledgeable student.,Plants serve a purpose and a gardner tends and monitors the plants to make them grow. Teacher need to make students useful and tend to them and let them grow.,A coach is a teacher and gives the athletes knowledge and they have to perform to use this knowledge same as a student. Teacher can give them knowledge but if they cant use it not useful,I think of the app store being the college itself. The college is the instrument that delivers the knowledge or app to the student.,Tour guide shows the people places and things and describe things. Teachers do the same thing but need a practical use of both.,Captain of the ship is the person in charge and sets direction and people must follow and not veer off course. If a teacher does this it does not expand thinking of the students.,I had both good and bad teachers in college. The best ones are the ones that gave us knowledge and practical uses of how to use it in the everyday world. Then they challenged me to implement that knowledge
Someone who is calm and collected and inquisitive. Someone who values ideas and thinking and spends time in thought on many occasions.,A teacher may mold a student to some extent but with free will and other influences the ability to do so is very much limited.,A teacher can grow a student into different levels of education but he does not have the ability to decide what kind of plant a student becomes.,I think thats true in the sense that a teacher trains a student like a coach. However I think the way that a coach acts aggressively towards his athletes is very different from a professor.,This is true in the sense that a student gets to choose what professor they learn from and utilize. However a professor doesnt quite offer the variety that is typical of an app store.,A teacher can show the students their own world view through a lens much like a tour guide. I think this is a good metaphor.,A teacher guides his students like a captain but a captain has more authority over his sailors than a professor does over his students.,Because this highlights the idea that a teacher is merely a guide who is showing the world to their students through their eyes sharing the experiences that they have had.
Someone passionate enough about their field of study that they want to share it with new generations. Alternatively someone interested in research and willing to teach on the side to get funding.,This analogy is okay. It places the responsibility for creating a beautiful work entirely in the teachers hands which Im not fond of. On the one hand it encourages the teacher to really look at their class like a passion project. On the other hand though the students are left with the options of being cooperative clay or not I guess?,This is just like the clay analogy. The teacher is in control here. They have all of the power. They decide whether or not the garden is beautiful or not. They do have a vested interest in helping the students grow but the students have no say in the matter. They just respond to stimuli.,This metaphor seems less strong than the sailing one because theres no easily imagined object like a boat tying student and teacher together. That said here too the students and teacher share a single goal to play well. The coach knows how to instruct their players to do so and by succeeding in their task everyone profits.,This sort of has the opposite problem of the clay analogy. Here the students are provided with a lot of options on what to see and how to use their findings. Thats great although its kind of a weird fit for a directed learning environment. The teacher is almost completely passive though. They can sort of proffer different ideas I guess but theyve no control over how the students use them.,This analogy is okay. The students are given a new world to explore and the tools to explore it. Meanwhile the teacher has the means to direct them so that they see all the important sites and no one gets lost. Theres no real incentive for the teacher to perform well here though. Theyre not new to this area. Theyve seen it before and like real life tour guides they might have some days where they just dont care if the tourists are impressed.,I like this analogy because it implies that the ship wont go anywhere if the students are not in sync with the teacher. The teacher knows how to sail the boat but to get moving he must teach the students what he knows. A classroom too is a structure without purpose if the students arent able to haul up the anchor as it were.,As I said in the explanation before I think this analogy works best because it puts teacher and student in the same boat. I mean theyre literally in a boat and they have a clear objective which is to figure out how to and then sail the thing so they get to wherever theyd like to head.
A college teacher is an expert in a particular subject matter. They are expected to speak well and care about the students education. They should be interested in their subject.,This makes the students sound completely passive which I dont like. Education is a result of the teacher and the student cooperating. Students have choices and different interests and arent just molded by the teachers.,This makes student completely passive. The students as plants depend completely on the action of the teacher which shouldnt be the case. It makes the process of educating overly simple formulaic and easy with both teacher and students not really working hard.,This is a fine metaphor. There is work and agency on the part of both students and teachers. However while success is exactly the same thing for every member of a team winning that isnt true for students who can all want and receive different things from the same teacher.,This makes teachers seem completely un unique as if everything they do is just a formula. It makes them sound like tools for the student to use and I think this is almost the opposite of teaching.,It makes the process of education sound casual and unimportant. Tourists are just visitors and dont really take anything away when they leave a place. Students should be dedicated to learning and plan for education to become a permanent part of who they are. A tour guide doesnt need to be much of an expert or have enthusiasm.,This is a great metaphor. The captain leads the crew and makes important decisions but doesnt do all the work. Different crew members have the same ultimate goal but their tasks and skills can vary.,The best college teachers steer things in a particular direction but dont dictate every single step to take to get there. Different sailors do different things just like different students have different talents interests and goals. I like the idea of the class the ship making progress in the right direction but having to travel and work to get there.
a highly educated person that teaches young adults on a specific subject matter at a very high level.,A scultor sculpts the clay into a finished product. A teacher also modifies what the students know into something that is a finished product.,The gardener often tries to get plants to grow and do better. A teacher is doing the same thing in the classroom as the gardener would do.,A coach is literally a type of teacher. That is by definition what they are doing. So this metaphor fits perfecty due to this comparison.,The app store contains all of the data. A teacher also contains all of the data. The phone and the students are then those that consume said data.,A tour guide takes those that follow them through something explaining along the way. A teacher does the same thing in the classroom.,The captain of a ship is like the guide that the sailors follow. The teacher is also a guide that the students follow on their academic journey.,A coach guides you through to the finish line. Ive had many coaches that I often thought of as teachers in my past. This is super similar to my past experience.
I think of someone that if they dont have a passion for teaching they can literally suck the life out of you. Your ability to learn comes from excitement passion for the subject and from hands on teaching stradegies. Teachers that are not burned out and still love to teach come across as being caring and thoughtful for the process of instilling information in such a way that it shows.,This metaphor is misleading as it is saying that the teacher can shape a person into something that they arent. People usually have their own impressions or abilities that a teacher may not know about and unless they learn about the student they arent molding anyone into anything.,Nurturing people is something that young people in college are not in need of. They need guidance and helpful information to be able to make it in a very competitive world and dont need nuturing. They need knowledge and need to become aware of what the real world is all about through learning.,In some instances this may be true but for the most part I think students are more like sponges that are taking in what they need to be able to thrive in a very competitive society. The teaching is in the hands of the teacher and they need to get their students excited to learn.,I dont like this metaphor as there are many apps and people rely on their cell phones I dont think this is appropriate to try to compare mechanical devices to things that arent necessarily a flowing changing living thing as I believe learning is.,I think that touring is more of a vacation and for not thinking too much about anything. Teaching should be about curiosity and the need to take in as much information as a person can while being interested the whole time.,This is more of a metaphor for people that are learning a specific task instead of being on the same level. There is such class discrimination onboard a ship where there are many levels of learning just a single task and being good at it instead of everyone being treated the same some lose out on learning if they are only performing a specific task.,I didnt think any of the metaphors were very good to try to explain teaching.
I think most college teachers are smart educated and helpful. They want to make a difference in education and in their students lives.,A teacher will mold their students into being well educated human beings.,A teacher helps students grow. They want their students to fully grow with the learning process.,That is the perfect analogy. Teachers are training students just like coaches train their athletes.,I think this is a weird analogy and I dont feel the need to explain myself.,A teacher is like a tour guide because they guide us through the learning experience while the students are taking a tour through learning different things.,A teacher is like a captain of the classroom. They are the boss and the students are there to learn from them.,I think its the perfect metaphor. It makes the most sense and reminds me of my college experience.
I think that a college teacher is often stuck up or self centered at times they are unconnected to the world outside of their field.,Often times we find teachers trying to mold students into what they see fit instead of what they want to be.,I think that a teacher is a gardener who only knows about trees but is growing watermelon.,They tell students what to do.,We do not get to pick what goes on its not like looking at the app store.,A tour guide who only takes you places where they like to be as opposed to showing you everything there is to see.,Teachers are the ones who dictate what occurs inside the classroom and often no matter what the students say it only matters what the teacher says.,I like it because it shows how teachers who are extremely knowledgeable in their field in touch with the topics they feel comfortable with. This happened to me in a Chicano study class the professor only talked about Gary Soto.
I refer them to as a professor. Someone with advanced knowledge of a wide range of subjects and experiences.,A professor is there to guide them which is sculpting them with the knowledge they need. Students can be soft and easy to work with if theyre given the resources theyre interested in learning with.,The professor helps them grow to become successful. The professor has plenty of resources needed to help students. If students are like the plants than they can live off of the professor to get what they need and to grow.,A professor is a leader for knowledge. Coaches are usually more demanding and expecting of performance that professors generally are. Some students can be like athletes in terms of them competing for the best grades in the class.,I somewhat agree with this because if the college student is a smart phone user theyre looking for information. The best resource to get information would be through the app store. The professor will be able to provide them with information theyre searching for.,This would apply more to a geography professor. The professor can show them what the students are interested in but the students are more involved in the process instead of an experience like a tourist usually gets.,The professor is always guiding the class for the better. The professor is very experienced. Students as the sailor listen to the captain so they know exactly what to do on their own.,I prefer it because teachers have a specific set of knowledge. They dont know everything when it comes to every subject theyre more specific in terms of what they teach. There would be a specific app for the specific knowledge.
I think of them as smart successful people who like their field of study more than they like students. They are narrowly experts.,Students are independent thinkers and are not malleable like elementary school teachers.,Students in college already know a lot of things and the professor teaches them information in a narrow field not to be taught how to think,The coach expects his athletes to work hard and perform well when it counts. Its a constant checking up system.,Students can choose to add drop switch courses whenever they want and can do so without repercussions and based on nonacademic reasons.,This is too casual a metaphor thinking like the tourists are not interested in more than a superficial look,Both the teacher and students are committed to going somewhere through the semester to arrive at a truth.,My college teachers were interested in arriving at some universal truth and sought student input in how to get there. Teachers knew the most but wanted to work together to arrive at something worthwhile.
The first image that comes to mind is of a man generally older and dignified. He has the stereotypical tweed jacket and smokes a pipe. However in my experience more college teachers have been women than men and they have varied greatly in age from very young to nearing retirement.,This is the most imaginative so far. The teacher uses his or her experience and expertise to try to mold the students into a more complete form. However one teacher in one class does not a finished sculpture or student make.,This one makes it sound like there is a lot less effort involved in teaching and learning than is generally the case. I think it gives too little credit to teachers.,Its not the most imaginative metaphor but its apt. The teacher has gone beyond the stage in his or her life when she would be an athlete or student and is now passing on his or her wisdom and guidance to the next generation.,This one was creative but I found it to be false. This would imply that a teacher has lots of different offerings and a student can choose which subject to learn. Maybe if the metaphor was A university is like an app store I would have agreed but not in this case.,It seemed a bit glib at first but the more I thought about it the more I realized that in one class or semester a teacher really cant do more than show you the sights. Its up to the students to decide how closely they want to look and if they want to go deeper.,Its true that the teacher is something of an authority figure but teachers and students generally arent working towards the same specific goal as would be the case with a captain and his or her sailors.,Like I wrote before its the metaphor that I feel best reflects reality. A teacher in a single semester cannot do much more than show the sights to his or her students just like a tour guide in an exotic city. Hopefully however the students decide to dig deeper on their own because they have been inspired to learn more. A great teacher and a great tour guide both provide this inspiration. I had a teacher just like this in my Intro to Business Law elective class who could truly only give the absolute bare bones of the subject in our 2 hours together each week but he showed me how fascinating the law is. While I didnt go on to study the law nor do I intend to I love reading Nolo guides.
I think there are a few great ones mostly good ones and mediocre ones and a few downright horrible ones.,Because a sculptor creates the sculpture while a teacher only helps teach or develop an existing students inner knowledge.,Because a gardener only takes care of plants growth and health while a teacher must teach and get through to students.,Because both a teacher and a coach help to develop skills and knowledge but physical things and mental intelligence arent exactly the same.,The app store has thousands if not millions of different apps ranging from A to Z while a teacher only has their limited area of knowledge.,Because a tour guide can guide anywhere mostly using a pamphlet and some practice learning the area while a teacher has mostly only their own area of knowledge.,Because a captain only gives orders to be followed while a teacher must teach and get through.,Because its the only one I feel comes anywhere close to being similar.
I think usually of a guy standing at a podium in a large lecture hall. I also think about the variety of TAs who teach the smaller discussion sections.,I dont think this works because it implies that all the work is done by the teacher and none by the student.,I guess thats somewhat true in that students ultimately grow on their own but a teacher might help the process along.,I dont think this fits because students can pretty much leave their team and join other teams freely.,This kind of works. The students are buying something but what they get out of it is up to them.,This works I think. Teachers show and tell but how much someone gets out of the experience is up to them.,I dont think this is particularly apt. Unlike a sailor a student can get off the ship any time they want.,After viewing the others I think its the most apt. Ultimately learning is in the hands of the student and cant be forced by the teacher. They can try to help it and they can prune the bits that dont belong but its still up to the student in the end.
College teachers give you a lot of freedom to express ideas. Also college teachers give you more personal responsibility.,I get the metaphor when it comes to younger students but college students are more like stone with the teacher is the sculptor in that sense.,Teachers give the students what they need to grow. Just like a gardener gives the plants what they need to grow.,Coaches by their nature are teachers. Instead of teaching a sporting concept. Teachers teach students other concepts so this metaphor works.,Just like the app store a teach can be accessed by the smartphone users the students for many different things and many different ways.,Guides show tourist around and give them information about where or what they are touring. Teachers do the same thing with students by showing them around.,A captain leads with no intention to teach his sailors. A teacher leads but also wants the students to grow and learn from how the teacher is leading.,I had many great teachers that gave me information and tended to me and watched me grow in life like the metaphor.
I think of the professor who is kind of a coolish hippie. Someone with elbow pads on his jacket. I think of someone who really enjoys learning and young people.,Students should be a little more than a lump of dirt but it is nice to imagine them as moldable.,Teacher is like a gardener who does his best to put out the sun and water. Students are supposed to be a little more active than plants but sure.,Students are responsible for their own learning. They have to be active and present. It isnt the professors job to necessarily motivate the student. It helps if he or she is enthusiastic about learning. Still I dont really like this metaphor.,I think this is very simplified. Teachers can be conduits for learning but you have to pay attention. You have to ask intelligent questions and you have to be present. A professor isnt really like something you can carry around in your pocket but he or she is available.,This is actually not bad. Teachers point things out. I like it.,At least this one involves people. Students are like sailors in the way they have to participate. They cant just be immobile objects moved around. They have to be active to move the ship. If they arent they and the ship wont go anywhere.,I like that there is involvement from everyone. I like that the teacher is involved but so is everyone else.
I think of a professional from the industry. I typically think of adjunct professors initially. The only time I think of full time professors is if they have a lab.,The teacher does not really sculpt the kids similar to sculpture to clay. the student can choose to learn the material themselves without the need of the teacher.,The teacher as the gardener can not mold the students as flowers. The student can choose to learn the material by themselves. A flower can not grow without the nutrients provided by the gardener.,The teacher assigns the work that he believes will teach the course. It is up to the student to pass. An athlete does not need to pass he does it because he wants to be competitive. Student passes to get the degree.,The teacher has the establishment the course to offer. Each app or teacher is different. The student gets the app and some may be attentive and others do not give a shit.,Yes. The tour guide tries their best to cater to the audience which is the student body. It is up to the student to decide whether to listen to the tour guide or let their minds wander similar to if you are a tourist.,Sailors must obey the captain however students do not need to obey the teacher. The students can do whatever they want. Its not life or death as long as they learn the material.,It reflects the essence of teaching because they want the students to know but it is up to the students to listen in or tune it out.
College teachers tend to be motivated primarily by concerns other than teaching students. Lectures are a necessary evil in order to work on their own projects. The more work that they can dump on a TA the better.,Disagree. Again in this situation the students are passive. Good students are active learners. Good teachers provide back and forth with students. The students should mold the teacher as well.,Somewhat agree in the sense that a good teacher can plant the seeds of new ideas in a new student and help weed out the bad ideas that might hold them back.,Somewhat agree in the sense that a coach provides the plan of attack and helps athletes focus on their strengths and discard bad habits in pursuit of their goal.,Disagree. Students cant really pick and choose what information they extract from the teacher. A good student is not just a consumer of information.,Disagree. Tourists are passive consumers of shallow content learning just whats on the placard or the blurbs of a tour guide. A good teacher takes students deeper into the subject matter.,Disagree. A good student must be an autonomous thinker and not just someone who follows the order and thinking of the teacher. A sailor would not challenge his captain but a good student will challenge his or her teacher.,it comes closest to the idea that the teacher pushes students in the right direction but that the students are ultimately responsible for their own growth. The teacher helps guide their growth much like a gardener tends his plants.
When I think about a college teacher I envision someone who is experienced in their field and who regularly contributes to the advancement of their field.,I agree with this metaphor because teachers have a large influence on what their students learn and potentially mold their students outlook on the field of study.,This metaphor makes the teacher seems like someone who is invested in their students and wants them to reach their full potential with careful and consistent attention. The teachers will one day reap what they sow in seeing their students become successful in their field of study.,This metaphor seems too broad because coaches are in a sense teachers in teaching the sport to the athletes but in the end they can be more focused on winning a game at the expense of some of the players.,This metaphor is confusing to me. Comparing teachers to an app store makes me envision them as providing a large variety of things that have many different uses some good and some not so good.,I feel that the word tourist used in regards to student indicates they have a passive role in their education rather than learning to be the tour guide themselves.,I am not very familiar with nautical references I am not too sure what a captain of a ship does other than lead the crew.,I prefer this metaphor because it shows that students are most likely going to grow but with careful and consistent attention from their gardener teachers they can grow even more than before. It helps me envision teachers as doing everything they can to provide an environment for success for their growing students.
I think of a person who is intellectual open and always learning. It is a person who loves to discover new things and enjoys a good conversation. They like tossing around ideas.,A teacher molds the students thoughts and ideas. They help the student form into a person who thinks for themselves.,A teacher carefully cultivates the student into becoming a successful person. The teacher gives the student the things the student needs to successfully grown into a productive person just like a gardener cultivates the plant.,The teacher is the person who guides the student like a coach on a sports team. He or she helps them develop skills to be a success.,I really do not understand or relate to that analogy. I guess the teacher can be considered as having all the tools that a student needs to succeed and the students just need to pick and use the tools.,The teacher shows the student the way and how to navigate the educational process of learning a skill. The teacher guides them through the path of learning.,The teacher is the overseer of the vessel that is education. The students are workers that help keep the ship going and they defer to the captain for help in their educational journey.,I like it because I believe the teacher is an overseer who guides the student in education. They help them develop the tools they need in mastering the educational system. This metaphor was seen several times in my past college career. A teacher helped me learn new skills to become a productive member of the work force and life.
College teachers are very intelligent. They have expertise in their subject or area and like to share their knowledge with others. Most of my college professors were a bit out of touch with their students.,I tend to disagree with this because I dont think teachers are meant to mold students. They are meant to educate and inspire present information with the intention of having their students form their own ideas and assertions.,I love this simile! A teacher gardener guides and encourages and nourishes a student plant with what it needs to excel.,Again this is a simile not a metaphor. A teacher much like a coach is an encourager a guide on the side a person in charge a leader. Students are like athletes in that they listen and respond to the coach and they work hard.,This does not make as much sense. An app store suggests that the user has a choice as to which app they might pick. The students however doesnt get to choose the topic of study in a teachers class.,This simile reminds me of a history teacher. A tour guide would take you around and show you the most important places and things. A teacher does the same whether it be in history or science math or music. The teacher tour guide shows the student tourist all of the important elements of their discipline.,Though that is not a metaphor it is a simile it does make sense in relation to teaching. The teacher is the one with the power and knowledge much like a captain while a student is like a sailor being guided by the captain.,This fits my impression for a few different reasons. First tour guides and tourists have a kind of impersonal relationship. It is a short but influential relationship. Second the tour guide has a wealth of information on a particular subject and the tour guide wants to learn or hear about this information much like a teacher and student. Third a tour guide is a leader of a group and the tourists are the group that follows the tour guide much like a teacher and student relationship.
A smart person that is patient with kids. A friendly person that is helpful for the society. They are very patient to graduate college and become a college teacher. It shows a teachers intelligence to teach at that level.,The teacher sculpts the clay for their children that they are teaching. They are molding them on how to have morals and intelligence. The children have to be sculpted in order to learn and succeed.,The teacher is more like the plants because they are already made and are adults teaching the children. They have built themselves up like a plant and now the gardener the children have to do work and find success like the teacher taught them.,That is true teachers are like coaches and the students are like athletes because the teachers is teaching them on how to do good work and succeed. Just like a football game the coach is teaching his players on how to win and succeed.,The teachers are already made and is teachers are teaching their children. The children need to do work in action to succeed with what the teacher taught them.,The teacher is head and teaches the kids on how to solve problems and be a better person. Teachers are like tour guides because they are being looked upon to be taught right and do good in school.,Yes teachers are like captains because they are the leaders for the children. The children are like sailors because they have to learn how to sail before they can become good and successful.,I was once a athlete and did great in school as well in high school. I chose this one because the teacher is the leader and the athletes are the followers. The coaches teaches his team how to do good and win and be successful. Same as the attitude a good teacher should have.
Someone very educated and trained who cares a lot about knowledge and wanting to share it with others. I think of someone dedicated to lifelong learning.,This is somewhat true in the sense that the teacher is molding and shaping the students through what they teach them and what they learn but especially for older students I would say this puts too much emphasis on the power of the teacher and doesnt give any power to students. Students arent just helpless lumps of clay. They also participate and can contribute to the outcome.,The teacher spends time tending to their students just like a gardener does and doing things to nurture them and help them grow like water them give them food make sure they have good conditions to thrive. If they do this they will grow and thrive. If they neglect the students they will wilt and not learn.,I think this is true. A coach teaches encourages and supports athletes as they progress and work to achieve their goals. Teachers do the same thing for students and it is an ongoing collaborative relationship that results in achievement if done properly or lack of success if no work and effort are put into it.,I can see this being true. Students are able to go to the store and get what they need and use it to their benefit. Same thing with a teacher and a class. This puts power in the hands of the students to pick and choose what they want to learn from the teacher just like they pick and choose at an app store.,This is somewhat true in the sense that the teacher is a guide showing the tourists around and showing students what there is to see. It is up to the students what they want to make of it and if they want to explore it further,I dont really think this is true. A captain is in charge of a ship and the sailors all do what the captain says to do in order to keep the ship going. In this metaphor what is the ship? I dont see anything that it could possibly represent. I mean in a tiny sense this is true because the captain is in charge and the sailors are doing what he says but a classroom shouldnt just be a dictatorship.,I think it fits best because it puts empowerment into the hands of the students and gives them the responsibility of picking the right tools from the class and teacher and using them to their benefit rather than implying its the teachers responsibility.
A college teacher helps their students to think of topics from different perspectives and foster independent thinking. They also help prepare students for their chosen career.,While I agree that teachers help to mold students I again feel that students must engage and have an active role in molding themselves as well.,This is also a good metaphor students grow and change with their teachers aid and each student becomes a unique individual.,I definitely agree here because with this metaphor the students can vary in ability based on how well they listen to the coach and their individual motivation and athletic ability.,This partially applies but in the case the active and passive role of the metaphor is flipped. Here it seems the student actively seeks information and the teacher provides it. However the teacher also provides information the student didnt even realize they were looking for.,I think the student has more of an active role in learning and the idea of being a tourist is very passive.,The teacher leads the ship and the students follow. I agree but I also think it makes the students seem like blind sheep.,I liked this metaphor because it emphasizes the advising and teaching role of the teacher and the individuality of the students. They are not all being molded the same or taking all of the nurturing from the teacher but instead growing and changing in their own ways.
An accomplished professional in his or her field he or she is capable of imparting this knowledge to others.,The students are not unmolded raw material they are thinking sentient beings. They shouldnt be sculpted rather they should be given the information without any external spin and allowed to make decisions for themselves.,I dont agree that students are really plants because theyre sentient beings capable of making their own decisions. However I do agree that a teacher should nurture knowledge and help the students grow.,The coach guides the general direction of the team but in a classroom theres no single real world objective like there is on a team. Hopefully the teacher or coach will impart some knowledge on the students or athletes along the way.,The students should not pick and choose what they want to learn. Theyre paying to be there for a reason. Theres a vast breadth of knowledge in both the app store and the teacher but the students should try to absorb a lot more of it percentage wise from a teacher than they do an app store.,There is a lot about a certain topic to learn and the teacher knows it well making them the tour guide. The students do not so theyre the tourists learning from the more experienced individual.,The whole classroom is heading towards a specific destination that is knowledge and the teacher guides that. However the sailors are free to make decisions as they choose.,There is objective knowledge and there is subjective experience. A tour guide tries to incorporate both which is what a good teacher should do.
A college teacher is a presenter. They dont guide you by the hand like a teacher in secondary school or in elementary school. They bring you to the information you need but your own effort is needed to digest the material.,I dont believe so in this case it applies much. Sometimes a teacher will mold students with their own values and their own perspective of the world but more often I see them as less engaged with the students in making them follow a certain way. Although it can happen and there is a sort of rough around the edges aspect that does apply in my opinion.,I could see this being apt if the students are getting a lot from the experience and growing like a plant. But this metaphor places more of the responsibility on the teacher and in real life it is the students who have to mature or wither not the gardener.,I dont believe this applies unless the students are in some sort of academic team or under the mentorship of a professor. But most teachers dont meet this level of leadership or guidance at least for the majority of their students.,I can agree with this one the teacher is an app store with all the information and the knowledge. The students then based on their own focus and desire to engage will opt in or not. Some students users will make sure to get the most of the experience and pay extra to get more out of the experience.,I mentioned this in a previous response actually. I completely agree the teacher is showing them the importance of wherever they are and the tourists have the choice to either pay attention and ask more or allow themselves to get distracted. This captures university exactly in my opinion.,I dont see this one applying too much most teachers in college are not leaders unless theyre deans or heads of some organization. So I dont strongly disagree but most teachers arent looking to navigate their own ship with the students as crew. Maybe time to time in certain settings. In general the teacher is more like a tour boat guide.,Mentioned it previously but it fits perfectly because the teacher is a tour guide showing the students what is important and what they need to focus on. A great teacher will be full of knowledge and know how to engage and keep the students interested while also educating them on what they need to know. But like a tourist the students can either pay attention and ask questions or challenge it or not pay attention at all. This captures university in the US very well for me although in graduate school this changes a bit.
When I think of a college teacher I think of someone who is educated and inspiring. I think of someone who loves to teach others but took their education to the next level to reach higher goals of teaching.,I can see this as teachers help shape students.,Just like a gardener helps plants grow a teacher helps students grow.,A coach guides athletes just a teacher guides students.,I dont think this one is a realistic example.,Teachers guide students like tour guides guide tourists.,Teachers guide students along just like a captain guides a ship.,It just seems like the most realistic metaphor. Coaches teach athletes what to do and they do it and same with teachers and students.
At this level teachers are scholars in a particular subject in which they have passion. They may do research publish or be otherwise engaged in the subject outside of teaching.,A little too strong but yes there is an aspect of molding when it comes to teaching. The professor often is getting students to think in a certain way to develop certain critical skills.,This is better than the sculpture analogy because it has the same strengths but puts more limits on the teacher. Plants grow due to many factors. The gardener tries to influence but like a teacher is limited.,Very much. Coaches are teachers and they have a lot of authority. Students must do what the teacher says and not everyone makes the cut. Students like athletes are judged by performance.,One has control over an app. It does what you want and results are often personalized. A college teacher is an authority who presides over you. You do what the teacher wants.,Allan Bloom uses this metaphor in his classic The Closing of the American Mind. One of his students called him the worlds greatest tour guide. In his view the role of the teacher is to guide the student through history to expose the student to new ways that are not easily viewable by oneself. He uses Platos analogy of the cave as an example.,This works. Not all the time but works especially for advanced classes. Here the teacher and student are on the same team trying find the truth or reach a destination. This is how seminars are often taught. But introductory classes are different. Students cannot yet help the professor the way a sailor helps the captain.,Since I referenced Allan Bloom in my response Ill quote him now One of the most flattering things that ever happened to me as a teacher occurred when I received a postcard from a very good student on his first visit to Italy who wrote You are not a professor of political philosophy but a travel agent. Nothing could have better expressed my intention as an educator. He thought I had prepared him to see. Then he could begin thinking for himself with something to think about. The real sensation of the Florence in which Machiavelli is believable is worth all the formulas of metaphysics ten times over. Education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.
Someone who has gone out of their way to get knowledge to others. Someone who wants to make and work just enough to get tenure.,Its like a teacher is sculpting the student into a model of something that needs to be made.,The teacher is watering the students with knowledge and feeding them nutrients so that they can grow big and strong.,Teachers are going out their way to try and teach people things they need to be able to grow into being adults and go down the path they choose.,This honest to god makes no sense at all in any way shape or form.,That would imply the students are only there for a little bit and that they are just walking through the area.,That would be like they were all headed to the same goal. A teacher is not on the same boat as the students.,It shows that teachers are feeding and watering students so that they can grow tall and into good plants.
I think of a college teacher as someone very intelligent and knowledgeable in their field of study. They are usually very articulate and communicate well.,This analogy is okay. I can see it at least that the sculptor forms the clay but students are learning from the teacher it is not necessarily a forming experience.,This is a decent metaphor. The teachers impart knowledge that helps the students grow just like a gardener feeds and waters the plants to help them grow.,I like this analogy. Coaches help athletes grow and learn about their sport just like a teacher helps students.,I dont like this metaphor much. The app store doesnt impart knowledge like a teacher does and we do not necessarily learn from apps.,This metaphor is okay. A tour guide leads the tour and shows the tourists things they have not seen before. This can be similar to a teacher.,I dont agree with this analogy. Sailors generally work for the captain but he doesnt normally teach them like a teacher.,It is very similar actually. The relationship is almost the same. Athletes learn from the coach like students learn from the teacher.
I think of someone who loves what they do. They are passionate and want to truly see their materials shared with others.,I can understand the molding of a student but I dont think that students are blocks of clay that are only molded into one planned thing. They mold themselves.,I could see what they mean. The gardener works to care for and tend to the plants. If they dont take careful action the plants could wither away to nothing. They could also grow out of control. A gardener would provide what they need to grow properly.,A student has the basic information and can find the information anywhere. Knowing how to apply the information properly is an art.,I dont even understand this one it doesnt make any sense to me.,I dont really care for this one. Yes the tour guide has the information and tourists want to learn. I just think its almost too literal and I just dont really care for it. You are not there to sightsee you are there to learn.,I guess this one works. The teacher is guiding the ship where they want and the sailors are learning as they go.,I explained it in the previous pages but it demonstrates heart and care.
A man or woman who shares knowledge they have with others through a variety of methods. A college teacher is focused on the success of their students in understanding the material.,College professors do not change students. Students personalities and core traits are established by college.,College teachers try to cultivate strong thinking skills. The course a student is on is pretty set like a plant but as with gardening a teacher can influence how well a student grows in their thinking.,A college teacher is like a coach they guide students to success. They are unlike a coach in that they show more compassion and do not bench people for poor performance.,College teachers dont give students what the students want when they want it like an app store. Teachers are the ones who choose what to share.,College teachers show new things to students like a tour guide. One difference is that college teachers form stronger bonds with their students as the term progresses.,A class of students is like a crew. The class and teacher share common goals and the teacher guides the class. Not a perfect metaphor as there can be more than one way to complete a task. On a ship there are set ways of doing things.,I like this metaphor because plants are going to be the plants they are going to be and it is the same with students. Some students grow to be great thinkers others struggle. A college teacher does their best to help each student reach their best potential like a gardener does with plants.
I think of someone who worked really hard. To get what they want. They are a smart person who makes good decisions constantly.,,I disagree because most things we are taught are useless. This applies more to parents than children.,,,,This makes more sense because they are steering you into a positive future.,I think it fits because they are steering you to a good future.
Someone who helps mold a student to their career so they are able to succeed in life and whatever they decide that they want to do in the future.,The teacher is molding the students into what they can be in the future and they are molding them like clay to be the best that they can.,Teachers help students grow just like plants in a garden start off as a seed and nothing then they grow because they are being taken care of.,I think a teacher can be like a coach where they are helping them and telling the what to do but I dont think they are much like a coach.,I dont think this has anything to do with teaching and teachers helping students at all.,I dont think this helps the metaphor at all teachers are not guiding the students but they are teaching them.,I dont think this has anything to do with teachers they are not training them like a job.,I prefer this metaphor the best because it shows how something can start small and a teacher helps them bloom and grow to be their best self.
Generally a thoughtful person who knows a lot and has some deep insight into things. They may be careful in what exactly they output as they only have limited time to educate students.,This is too heavy of an emphasis on the teacher as the sculpture has no role other than existing.,This is a pretty good metaphor as the teacher provides inputs and the student takes it and grows.,Decent in that the athletes perform the work and the teacher gives them advice and guidance.,A teacher does provide a service like an app. A student uses the teacher to gain their service knowledge. A person uses an app to gain something from it.,Not the best but there is some relevancy as the teacher does guide students through the world of knowledge and shows them important areas to study.,Doesnt really translate well. The captain and sailors exist for the purpose of getting the ship to a location not for the sake of sailors self improvement.,The teacher provides for the plant and the plant takes in what it is given and uses it to build itself up. It is a two party system in which each fulfills a role but the majority of the actual work is performed by the student but in the proper environment.
Some college teachers engage when they are teaching a subject where it makes things interesting. Others do not and simply read exactly what is in the textbook.,A teacher is molding your brain in the sense that you start out with some clay and slowly form it into something.,Like a garden you are trying to nurture your plants the same with a teacher they are slowly watching your brain grow.,A coach is someone who motivates his team. You can think of your classroom as a team and the teacher is motivating you.,I dont agree with this because you cant always pick your teacher like you can an app.,I kind of agree with this because when you go on a tour you are with someone who is knowledgeable about the area or object you are looking at. The same with the teacher they are the ones sharing their knowledge.,Because they are the ones teaching us something new. Just like a captain you follow the leader. Sailors are taught how to sail. Students are taught by listening to a subject matter from the expert.,I like the analogy of you start with a seed as a gardener and slowly watch it grow into something. Where as with a student you have a new one every semester to plant that seed and watch it grow.
They are frequently devoted to research and not great at working with students. This applies to a lot of them and they are frequently strict.,Teachers mold students into what they want. They can do that by teaching various things which mold the children and their lives.,Teachers have to water their students with knowledge. They feed knowledge to their students and have to keep their brains fresh and neat.,This doesnt have anything to do with learning and coaches dont really teach much of anything they just train the athletes. I dont really see the similarity.,Teachers are not like app stores. Maybe they are more like apps though and students are more like smartphone users. Each app is unique.,I can see how this is a good metaphor. It makes sense since teachers teach and students listen. Teachers need to show the world and students need to learn it.,Teachers must discipline others and lead the students like a captain of a ship. Sailors though dont really learn anything or are taught anything.,I prefer this because teachers are showing a new world of knowledge to students. Thus they are like tour guides and must show the sights to students tourists. It makes the most sense in a knowledge learning way. It makes the most sense because tour guides teach and tourists listen.
College teachers run the gamut but arent usually great people persons and often struggle with communication. College teachers are often better researchers or academics than they are actual teachers.,I agree partly with this. Students have much more influence on their own molding than the quote implies. However in general the educating and shaping of the students is in the hands of the professor. The students definitely have a degree of helplessness and impotence. Without the professors guidance and expertise there is only so much the students can do.,This seems very similar to the sculptor or clay metaphor and I agree with it to a degree. The growing and learning of the students is largely in the hands of the professor. They are the ones who know where theyre going and how they have to get there. However just like with the previous metaphor this one fails to place onus on the students themselves. Plants do basically nothing but sit there. Students must be far more active in their own educations to learn or accomplish anything regardless of the actions of the teacher.,While there is definitely a little bit of truth here since teachers and coaches arent completely dissimilar I dont agree with the notion that the class is necessarily like a team. Not everyone works together necessarily. Classes are more loose than that and students arent necessarily working towards a shared goal. True the goal is the same but that doesnt mean its a shared goal. Students are competing against one another largely and even the teacher may be seen as an antagonist.,Im not even sure I understand the metaphor and I definitely dont agree with it. The app store in this metaphor has a passive participation in the process while the students are placed in charge. Thats backwards and wrong. While the students are actively involved the teacher is the leader and isnt just a resource when and if the students feel like using it.,This is getting a little closer to something I would agree strongly with. I like the idea of this being a journey of sorts with the teacher being the learned one who knows the terrain and the students coming along for the trip. Theres no requirement for the students to be passive here but they can be if they choose to be. And the teacher knows not only where theyre going but how theyll get there and the details along the way.,I dont really agree with this for two primary reasons. First the ship metaphor implies a more complicated hierarchy and thats not really how a class works. In a class theres just one leader and everyone else is a follower as opposed to having levels of leadership. Second of all I never felt college classes had that feeling of everyone working towards the same goal. Not only were things organized more loosely than that but I felt the teacher was more of an antagonist than a leader. It was us against him or her.,I think this is most illustrative of the relationship between teachers and students. Teachers are the experts. They know where the class is going how theyre going to get there and the details along the way. The students are guided there by the teacher but they dont have to be passive can ask questions etc and they dont even have to pay attention if they dont want. The teacher would like them to follow and like them to pay attention but thats up to the students. The teacher is just a guide not a taskmaster or a teammate. It is ultimately the students responsibility to get things out of the tour. Also I dont think classmates are necessarily buddies or on the same team or anything like that. Theyre individuals who may or may not band together but they arent inherently interested in a shared goal with each other or even with the teacher. So the tour guide metaphor works there too.
An educated person who is dedicated to teaching and has a passion for improving others lives. They strive to make each student a better person. ,This makes sense because the teacher is molding their brains and personalities to be productive members of society.,A teacher tends to her students like a gardener as they help to make them grow as a person. ,This really resonates with me because a teacher is exactly like a coach academically for their students. ,I disagree with this because this statement has no hierarchy and generally makes no sense. ,I like this because it indicates the teacher is guiding them through life and showing them the different scenery so they can soak it all in. ,This one I do not like because it indicates students are just regular workers or even slaves to the captain. There is no learning aspect to this statement. ,It fits because a lot of my teachers have all had a hand in molding me to be the person I am today. 
A professor who is specialized in a certain subject and teaches several different courses at a college or university.,The metaphor makes sense since teachers tend to shape students way of thinking and help mold them into slightly different versions of themselves.,This metaphor makes sense since gardeners cultivate plants like teachers have to cultivate students to foster a positive learning experience and environment.,This metaphor makes sense because like a coach with athletes working toward winning games a teacher rallies their students to work toward goals such as exams and projects.,I dont really understand the reference here. It just doesnt make for a metaphor that translates well to teachers and students.,This metaphor makes sense because a tour guide illustrates and enables tourists to see and experience things that they would not otherwise without their help similar to how a teacher guides their students to learn.,It makes sense since a professor tends to lead a class of students like a captain would lead a ship.,I prefer this metaphor because I believe it most accurately captures the essence of the teacher or student relationship. Students have to grow on their own but teachers are there to foster their growth and development.
When I think about a college teacher I think about a teacher with a little more freedom than a high school teacher.,A teacher is like a sculptor and students are like clay because the teacher is shaping the students minds by teaching them.,A teacher is like a gardener and students are like plants because the water is the knowledge that the teacher is giving the students. The more knowledge the more the students have a chance to grow.,A teacher is like a coach and students are like athletes because the teacher is pushing the students to new heights by teaching them.,I dont see how teachers and app stores have any similarities. An app store has so much information good and bad. A teachers job is to give meaningful information and not all apps give meaningful information. ,A teacher is like a tour guide and the students are like tourist because the teacher is showing the students all there is to know about where they are headed.,The teacher is like a captain because the teacher is the head of the classroom and the students are like sailors because they are under the teacher.,My college years shaped the way I see the world today
A college teacher is smart and can communicate ideas. They are knowledgeable and helpful to students.,Teachers dont have that much influence on students. Students dont start out as a blank slate.,A teacher doesnt raise and care for students from birth like a gardener does with plants. A gardener is more like a parent.,I disagree because I think coaches are more authoritative than a teacher. Teachers also arent as close to their students as coaches are with their team.,I disagree because an app store doesnt care about smartphone users and app users are more in charge of the app store than students are in charge of the teacher.,I somewhat disagree because teachers go more in depth on topics than a tour guide would,I disagree because students dont just follow orders from a teacher like sailors do with captains.,I prefer this metaphor because coaches do teach their athletes and want them to succeed just like teachers want their students to succeed.
A reliable source of knowledge in different areas or topics that are academic in nature as a result this person can be trusted to teach.,A teacher helps us become who we want to be so in a sense we are like clay and the teacher helps us transform into a final product.,The teacher transforms the plants and shapes them to be great in many senses. ,A teacher shapes us and gives us advice and knowledge on how to become better every time. A coach is the same way they want the best for us.,The users use and store all the content that the app in this case the teacher provides.,The tour guide provides knowledge of the area and the tourists absorb that knowledge to know more.,The teacher is the leader in the classroom. They know how to steer the conversation about facts of the subject. The students or sailors must understand every command to get experience.,I think it has to do with training for the athletes the same with studying different subjects. 
Its a challenging job and a really important one. It is a job that should be taken seriously as it comes with many responsibilities. ,Its a great metaphor because it denotes that the teacher has experience sculptor and is responsible for molding young minds clay.,A teacher is like a gardener since they are attending to the plants students and giving them nourishment in the form of knowledge.,This is a great metaphor for the student teacher relationship because a coach is responsible for instilling and developing skills as well as motivating young athletes much like the teacher is responsible for instilling the required skills in all their students.,Very true because apps are so useful and help us with so many of our daily activities.,A tour guide imparts tips and useful information to tourists about a new place and so too does a teacher to students. ,This is a great metaphor for the student teacher relationships because a ships captain is responsible for steering the ship and the safety of all the passengers much like the teacher is responsible for steering all the students in the right direction. ,This one was my favourite metaphor because to me it explains so well the bond as well the relationship which students and teachers share. Students need the guidance of teachers like sailors need to be guided by their captain as he or she steers them forward onto the right course which could also be symbolic of their path or destiny. I have certainly felt similarly with my own experiences of the teaching that I have received in college.
When I think of a college teacher I think of someone who is progressive and liberal. I think of someone who is well educated and is open to different ideas. ,I agree with this metaphor because the teacher is the one who pushes his beliefs on the students. The teacher says what they think of an issue and the students agree with this or disagree with it. Some students get molded like clay. ,I somewhat agree with this metaphor in the sense that the teacher can mold the students into having certain beliefs about certain things. The teacher pushes their beliefs on students. ,I agree with this metaphor because teachers are the ones who guide students into what to study. Teachers are the ones who tell students what to study so they can improve in whatever the subject is ,I dont agree with this metaphor because I do not see the correlation between students being smartphone users and getting apps from the store,I agree with this metaphor in the sense that students follow the lead the teacher sets. The students are guided by the teacher. ,I agree with this metaphor because the sailors follow the lead of the captain. The students agree to study and listen to what the teacher is saying. The teacher is the one who sets the path that the students follow just like a captain of a ship sets the path for the sailors. ,I prefer this metaphor because I think it is the most accurate description of teaching. It fits my experiences of what I went through when I was studying in college. Teachers are coaches that push students to improve in certain areas. They direct them on what to study. 
A professor who is usually more focused on research than academics but will typically help you if you ask. They do not waste time coming after you if you dont make an effort first.,This is not as good because clay assumes the role of the molded. The sculptor can guide but there is a difference between sculpting your own image and guidance. Ideally you would guide them to build their own. This analogy turns it around slightly and dilutes the meaning.,Im not fond of this analogy because plants do not have the capability to respond outside of their original placement. They can grow but they cannot change no matter how the gardener tends to it. This is an important distinction and it is that distinction which makes this not so good.,Generally speaking coaches are there to plan the route provide guidance and help steer those under their care in the right direction. The students or athletes are responsible for the physical action of making that happen. In other words its on them to put in the effort.,The idea of a teacher being an app store and the students being smartphone users is a bit of a stretch but it does have similar meaning to the other analogies. Im not too fond of referring to the teacher as an app store though because it implies the students simply access knowledge at will. It says nothing about the teachers resources or longevity of the accessed information.,Not the best but it does have common points. The teach in this role acts as a guide but the students should not be labeled as tourists. It implies they are there only to consume. Tourism does not necessarily mean that as it could be a learning experience but it does sort of imply the former.,Its a little less refined than the coach and athlete analogy but its similar. The captain simply navigates and helps keep things in line as well as provides direction. The sailors are responsible for implementing this as well as taking care of their other responsibilities. Its not quite as good of an analogy though.,Again college students are not children. By that point in their lives they only need guidance and should be left alone to create their own paths. So in this context that would mean that the teacher simply coaches by giving game plans support and examples while the implementation is up to the students athletes. That is they must put forth the effort to succeed. It cannot be handed to them. Out of all the ones given this is the most accurate representation. 
A person who is very laid back and comfortable with not only themselves but in the situations they are put in daily. ,This is a perfect metaphor because it describes exactly how a teacher would carry themselves on numerous different occasions. So to me I understand it 100%.,This one is good too and really depicts a teacher and their operations they go through. Really showcasing how they carry themselves. ,I feel this is something that makes sense and you can actually see teachers being this way on a day to day basis. ,I dont really understand this one and nor do I think its a very descriptive way of telling how a teacher or someone is in this specific metaphor. ,This one to me doesnt make that much sense. I get what was going for it but I dont really like the comparinson. ,I feel that they are without them being how they act and carry themselves then whos going to lead the ship? Nobody if you ask me. ,To me it makes sense and really gets the metaphor hammered to you and you cant help but to understand. 
Learned professors keepers of all knowledge willing to disperse it to hundreds of eager students at a time.,And here we are back in the kinda sorta maybe category. I heard once that Michelangelo said that his job wasnt to carve the statue from the stone it was to simply remove all the bits that werent the statue. That the statue was already inside. I have a friend who works in clay. When shes throwing clay it almost feels like a battle to get the clay to go where she wants it to go. So that part could be accurate. I think a more accurate metaphor in this vein would be that the students were apprentices to the master sculptor their teacher and the teacher was merely teaching them how to cut away the bits of themselves that werent their true self.,This metaphor is more appropriate than the last one. Teachers do tend to their students nurturing them and helping them grow. They can even be the people who remove obstacles i.e. weeds from the students growth. The problem is that the teacher didnt plant the students. Their parents did. their parents instilled a basic love for learning or for subject matter so the students would want to grow in that area.,Ill go along with this one. Athletes must be taught the rules of the game. Athletes must be taught how to play. Athletes must be taught safety. Athletes must be taught gamesmanship and fair play. Athletes must be taught everything about their sport from the ground on up. The same can be said for philosophy economics higher mathematics linguistics physics and all the rest. ,Absolutely not. You dont get to walk into a classroom and tell your teacher Ok were going to talk about the history of the Cheerio today. Heres $1.99. The teacher sets the syllabus chooses the subject matter makes the choices drives the train steers the ship leads the tour decides the things. The students far in advance choose the courses maybe with a little knowledge of the instructor maybe without. Its the course they want not the teacher.,I think this metaphor is alright but not great. Not even good. It implies that students are only popping in for a quick visit to knowledge or learning before they head back home to ignorant bliss. And teachers are much more than tour guides. Tour guides show tourists the highlights only they dont get into the nitty gritty details the rich culture behind the village on the side of the mountain overlooking the bay. They just say And here we have Peaceful Village #274.,I like this metaphor a lot. The teacher is at the helm steering the ship to whatever port of call will be the most instructive. Maybe were learning about American agriculture today so off the boat goes to the port of Des Moines to learn about corn wheat and soy. Were the students shanghaied? Maybe a bit. But for the most part they signed on for this voyage.,First off Im enjoying the mental picture of some of my college professors as pirates shivering their timbers with eye patches and parrots on their shoulders. I think this metaphor is the most apt because the teacher sets the course its syllabus and exactly what will be taught just as a ship captain sets the course makes daily decisions to detour here or there and guides the shipboard operations all the while. Students pile in to a lecture hall or the cargo hold of the boat get their marching orders or syllabus and off they go to the port of Des Moines.
An experienced at least in engineering professional that wishes to impart their wisdom and knowledge upon a generation of young folks.,They mold students into their idea of a student but I think most molds are already defined.,They tend and grow their pupils intellectual health.,Coaches develop talent already there just refining it.,I dont use a cell phone.,Tour guides show points of interests just skimming the surface of area.,Even though a captain commands they do not educate the sailors on all workings of a ship.,They plant the seeds of knowledge tend to the growth of that knowledge and finally fine prune that knowledge guiding it.
