TourGuideExplain
This,would,be,the,best,one,so,far,that,I,have,read,here,.,The,tour,guide,is,the,brains,of,the,operation,and,is,teaching,and,showing,the,tourists,about,everything,.,The,guide,is,literally,guiding,them,through,the,area,or,whatever,it,is,they,are,touring,and,knows,what,direction,to,lead,them,in,and,how,to,get,there,.,The,college,teacher,does,the,same,for,the,students,.
Teacher,tell,us,how,to,survive,in,the,outside,world,and,also,give,some,tips,and,guts,and,they,encourage,us,to,pick,out,our,talents,and,also,they,boost,up,in,order,that,you,can,be,able,to,do,this,I,will,be,there,for,your,support,.
This,analogy,is,okay,.,The,students,are,given,a,new,world,to,explore,and,the,tools,to,explore,it,.,Meanwhile,the,teacher,has,the,means,to,direct,them,so,that,they,see,all,the,important,sites,and,no,one,gets,lost,.,Theres,no,real,incentive,for,the,teacher,to,perform,well,here,though,.,Theyre,not,new,to,this,area,.,Theyve,seen,it,before,and,like,real,life,tour,guides,they,might,have,some,days,where,they,just,dont,care,if,the,tourists,are,impressed,.
Disagree,.,Tourists,are,passive,consumers,of,shallow,content,learning,just,whats,on,the,placard,or,the,blurbs,of,a,tour,guide,.,A,good,teacher,takes,students,deeper,into,the,subject,matter,.
The,teacher,shows,the,student,the,way,and,how,to,navigate,the,educational,process,of,learning,a,skill,.,The,teacher,guides,them,through,the,path,of,learning,.
This,is,getting,a,little,closer,to,something,I,would,agree,strongly,with,.,I,like,the,idea,of,this,being,a,journey,of,sorts,with,the,teacher,being,the,learned,one,who,knows,the,terrain,and,the,students,coming,along,for,the,trip,.,Theres,no,requirement,for,the,students,to,be,passive,here,but,they,can,be,if,they,choose,to,be,.,And,the,teacher,knows,not,only,where,theyre,going,but,how,theyll,get,there,and,the,details,along,the,way,.
I,like,this,because,it,indicates,the,teacher,is,guiding,them,through,life,and,showing,them,the,different,scenery,so,they,can,soak,it,all,in,.
I,think,this,metaphor,is,alright,but,not,great,.,Not,even,good,.,It,implies,that,students,are,only,popping,in,for,a,quick,visit,to,knowledge,or,learning,before,they,head,back,home,to,ignorant,bliss,.,And,teachers,are,much,more,than,tour,guides,.,Tour,guides,show,tourists,the,highlights,only,they,dont,get,into,the,nitty,gritty,details,the,rich,culture,behind,the,village,on,the,side,of,the,mountain,overlooking,the,bay,.,They,just,say,And,here,we,have,Peaceful,Village,#,274,.
This,idea,is,more,in,line,with,what,I,believe,.,A,teacher,can,expose,a,student,to,many,landscapes,of,thought,and,the,student,is,invited,to,participate,.
Teacher,is,like,a,tourist,guide,and,student,is,like,a,tourist,to,guide,all,levels,of,techniques,.
Students,are,touring,through,the,country,of,knowledge,in,whatever,subject,they,are,taking,.,The,teachers,are,the,experts,hopefully,and,guide,the,tourists,around,.
I,think,that,a,professor,is,more,than,a,tour,guide,.,They,do,indeed,have,the,knowledge,but,do,not,just,spit,out,stuff,and,students,listen,.,They,have,a,deeper,understanding,of,the,content,.
The,teach,is,bringing,them,on,a,journey,but,I,think,I,only,somewhat,agree,because,a,tour,guide,is,providing,a,more,passive,experience,whereas,a,teacher,is,usually,there,to,get,the,subject,the,knowledge,embedded,and,deeply,understood,.
The,teacher,guides,the,students,in,their,educational,journeys,and,the,students,are,like,the,tourists,on,the,tour,and,looking,forward,for,their,education,and,in,their,studies,to,learn,more,.
A,teacher,is,supposed,to,teach,us,about,the,unknown,.,We,are,tourists,in,an,unfamiliar,location,and,they,are,the,guides,with,adequate,knowledge,about,our,surroundings,.
Students,dont,have,all,the,knowledge,about,a,subject,and,the,teacher,is,like,a,guide,in,that,they,can,inform,the,students,about,the,subject,at,hand,.,Students,are,often,stupid,like,tourists,as,well,floundering,about,with,no,idea,what,is,going,on,.
In,a,sense,the,teacher,is,the,tour,guide,guiding,students,through,a,topic,that,is,hopefully,new,to,them,just,like,a,tour,guide,would,guide,tourists,through,a,new,city,.,If,the,tour,guide,is,crap,the,tourists,lose,out,on,information,they,may,be,interested,in,.
Like,a,tour,guide,the,teacher,present,students,with,interesting,and,different,aspects,and,notions,on,the,students,journey,to,being,a,wellrounded,person,.
It,seemed,a,bit,glib,at,first,but,the,more,I,thought,about,it,the,more,I,realized,that,in,one,class,or,semester,a,teacher,really,cant,do,more,than,show,you,the,sights,.,Its,up,to,the,students,to,decide,how,closely,they,want,to,look,and,if,they,want,to,go,deeper,.
Allan,Bloom,uses,this,metaphor,in,his,classic,The,Closing,of,the,American,Mind,.,One,of,his,students,called,him,the,worlds,greatest,tour,guide,.,In,his,view,the,role,of,the,teacher,is,to,guide,the,student,through,history,to,expose,the,student,to,new,ways,that,are,not,easily,viewable,by,oneself,.,He,uses,Platos,analogy,of,the,cave,as,an,example,.
Tour,guides,show,points,of,interests,just,skimming,the,surface,of,area,.
