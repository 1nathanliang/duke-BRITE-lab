This,simile,in,more,appropriate,because,a,coachs,job,is,to,teach,a,skill,and,students,if,they,are,like,athletes,practice,the,skill,in,this,case,learning,about,a,subject,.,After,all,is,done,the,student,will,have,acquired,a,new,skill,or,set,of,ideas,.
Teachers,do,guide,students,like,coaches,.
Teachers,are,less,like,coaches,than,some,of,the,other,metaphors,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,coach,to,teach,all,the,good,habits,and,a,student,is,like,an,athlete,to,understand,the,teachers,ideas,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,coach,.,The,student,has,a,general,idea,of,what,to,do,.,The,coach,is,there,to,refine,and,make,them,better,.
Coaches,are,a,type,of,teacher,albeit,athletic,rather,than,academic,.,Athletes,learn,from,their,coaches,and,students,learn,from,their,teachers,.

They,can,nurture,athletic,ability,like,they,can,a,mind,but,kind,of,different,as,well,.
Like,a,coach,a,teacher,at,college,level,has,to,give,students,practical,advice,and,push,them,to,be,the,best,they,can,be,.,But,unlike,a,coach,the,class,is,not,necessarily,a,team,and,the,kind,of,team,spirit,you,go,for,in,sports,is,not,necessary,.
A,teacher,gives,wisdom,to,help,students,become,the,best,that,they,can,be,in,the,field,.
This,one,works,very,very,well,.,The,coach,is,guiding,and,teaching,the,athletes,and,has,the,same,goal,as,the,athletes,.,The,coach,is,a,mentor,to,them,and,they,all,work,together,toward,the,same,goal,.
Yes,this,is,similar,because,the,teacher,should,lead,and,the,students,follow,.
I,like,this,line,of,thought,the,professors,give,us,the,chance,to,become,great,athletes,so,to,speak,we,work,hard,and,carve,our,own,path,with,their,advice,and,guidance,.
The,teacher,is,like,the,coach,giving,knowledge,about,a,subject,just,like,a,coach,gives,tips,advice,and,strategy,to,athletes,.
Because,they,have,more,responsibilities,than,us,they,work,for,us,and,also,they,spend,their,valuable,item,with,us,they,sacrifice,everything,for,us,so,they,are,considered,as,metaphor,in,college,.
College,professors,dont,train,their,students,to,think,like,a,coach,does,to,an,athlete,.,They,indoctrinate,them,usually,with,liberal,ideas,.
Yes,the,coach,gives,the,students,advice,and,motivates,them,to,perform,better,in,the,world,.
This,is,a,fairly,accurate,metaphor,.,A,coach,is,to,athletes,what,a,teacher,is,to,university,students,.
No,.,Coaches,dont,do,that,much,and,do,not,affect,people,in,the,way,that,a,teacher,does,.

Although,a,college,teacher,is,responsible,for,teaching,their,students,adult,students,should,still,have,some,sense,of,being,able,to,speak,freely,and,openly,about,certain,concepts,and,factors,being,presented,.
I,dont,think,that,this,is,a,great,metaphor,but,it,technically,works,.,A,teacher,guides,the,students,like,a,coach,guides,athletes,.
This,explanation,also,does,not,quite,actually,fit,the,reality,of,what,is,going,on,in,a,class,setting,and,I,think,that,most,students,do,not,consider,their,teacher,to,be,like,a,coach,.
Teachers,do,motivate,but,there,is,more,to,it,.
I,guess,if,their,college,class,is,sports
I,also,agree,with,this,metaphor,as,the,teacher,much,like,a,coach,provides,a,game,plan,for,success,.,They,are,guides,for,the,students,minds,instead,of,their,bodies,.
This,suggests,that,the,students,all,want,to,be,part,of,the,team,but,that,is,not,true,.,Especially,in,general,education,classes,that,are,required,.
Teachers,are,to,students,as,like,coaches,are,to,athletes,.,They,help,guide,them,in,their,educational,path,and,help,them,to,succeed,in,their,studies,as,coaches,do,for,sports,.
A,teacher,could,be,like,a,coach,.,A,coach,and,teacher,are,one,and,the,same,both,pushing,their,students,to,achieve,the,highest,performance,possible,and,teaching,them,that,if,they,work,hard,enough,they,will,not,only,accomplish,their,goals,but,surpass,them,.
Yes,it,is,like,that,since,the,coach,guides,the,athletes,and,the,teacher,their,students,.
I,can,see,why,some,would,like,this,but,atheletes,get,paid,to,play,whether,through,salaries,or,scholarships,.,Most,students,are,not,paid,to,be,in,class,.
This,applies,for,the,most,part,.,An,athlete,grows,under,the,direction,of,a,good,coach,just,as,students,grow,from,the,knowledge,and,nurturing,received,from,their,teacher,.
When,the,coach,is,perfect,we,can,be,able,to,run,in,the,race,and,also,we,can,be,able,to,put,hard,work,according,to,it,.
I,can,see,how,its,true,mostly,.,The,coach,is,the,person,who,trains,the,athletes,to,be,better,at,what,they,do,mentally,and,physically,.,The,difference,is,it,is,for,a,game,and,a,team,.
Teachers,want,you,to,succeed,for,the,most,part,.,They,are,supposed,to,be,our,motivators,and,want,us,to,do,well,.
I,think,as,an,athlete,you,already,know,how,to,play,the,game,and,the,coach,is,there,to,just,guide,your,skills,and,make,you,better,.,As,a,teacher,many,times,you,are,going,in,with,no,knowledge,on,a,subject,.,I,think,these,two,things,are,totally,different,.,I,do,not,see,a,teacher,as,a,coach,.
Athletics,doesnt,make,sense,in,this,educational,situation,.,I,would,not,relate,the,two,.
This,is,one,I,can,definitely,wrap,my,mind,around,the,teacher,is,like,the,coach,of,the,classroom,of,students,and,all,of,them,together,can,be,seen,as,a,team,trying,to,reach,a,common,goal,.
Coaches,are,there,to,encourage,players,but,also,help,them,make,the,best,decisions,and,are,there,for,tough,love,when,its,needed,.,Too,many,college,students,think,they,can,simply,make,up,grades,with,extra,credit,and,that,shouldnt,be,the,case,.,Just,like,an,athlete,is,to,blame,if,they,perform,poorly,on,the,field,a,student,is,to,blame,if,their,grades,arent,up,to,expectations,.
This,is,probably,the,most,direct,metaphor,.,A,teacher,coaches,students,and,directs,them,what,they,need,to,do,.,They,dont,always,follow,exactly,what,they,say,because,they,have,a,mind,of,their,own,and,control,what,they,think,.
Teachers,are,supposed,to,guide,students,to,reach,their,full,potential,.,They,should,give,students,exercises,and,a,structured,environment,to,grow,.
A,teacher,is,definitely,like,a,coach,.,They,are,supporting,teaching,helping,and,coaching,us,to,learn,and,grown,as,people,.,We,are,growing,our,minds,!
Teachers,offer,knowledge,guidance,and,direction,to,train,students,to,become,more,effective,learners,.
A,coach,I,feel,is,more,of,a,mentor,and,I,do,not,see,this,as,a,good,comparison,.,Yes,coaches,can,teach,but,athletics,center,on,a,more,physical,approach,or,exercise,than,a,full,on,teacher,.
I,kind,of,agree,with,this,.,The,teacher,and,a,coach,teaches,and,cares,and,wants,to,be,sure,they,do,there,best,to,succeed,as,well,.
I,could,see,professor,or,student,being,very,similar,to,the,coach,or,athlete,relationship,.,The,athlete,or,student,already,has,some,experience,in,what,they,are,doing,but,they,need,more,guidance,to,learn,more,about,the,subject,or,sport,.
This,is,true,to,some,extent,except,most,athletes,are,self,selected,by,their,desire,to,be,on,the,team,and,they,want,to,perform,well,.,Thats,not,always,the,same,with,students,.
I,think,this,is,true,in,the,aspect,that,teachers,are,supposed,to,show,students,what,to,do,and,teach,them,how,to,do,it,.,They,are,also,supposed,to,motivate,them,so,that,they,do,their,very,best,just,like,coaches,.
The,teacher,urges,students,to,be,their,best,.,The,teacher,urges,students,to,practice,regularly,.,The,teacher,suggests,drinking,water,.
Coaches,are,just,there,to,make,sure,we,are,doing,things,properly,.,We,pretty,much,already,know,what,we,are,doing,they,are,just,there,to,tweak,things,.
This,is,getting,closer,.,A,coach,imparts,wisdom,and,keeps,the,team,on,track,.,Thats,a,lot,of,what,teaching,is,.
This,is,an,obvious,one,.,Sometimes,teacher,are,coaches,too,.,They,are,essentially,doing,the,same,things,when,they,teach,and,coach,and,that,is,to,get,kids,to,learn,something,.
I,do,not,think,teachers,and,students,are,like,coaches,and,athletes,.,Coaches,provide,the,plan,and,guide,their,athletes,with,the,tools,necessary,to,succeed,.
A,teacher,is,someone,that,guides,a,student,not,command,them,.,This,is,what,a,coach,does,.,Instead,the,teacher,should,serve,as,a,gentle,and,understanding,guide,and,the,student,should,be,free,to,choose,what,they,want,to,do,.
A,coach,is,a,teacher,and,gives,the,athletes,knowledge,and,they,have,to,perform,to,use,this,knowledge,same,as,a,student,.,Teacher,can,give,them,knowledge,but,if,they,cant,use,it,not,useful
I,think,thats,true,in,the,sense,that,a,teacher,trains,a,student,like,a,coach,.,However,I,think,the,way,that,a,coach,acts,aggressively,towards,his,athletes,is,very,different,from,a,professor,.
This,metaphor,seems,less,strong,than,the,sailing,one,because,theres,no,easily,imagined,object,like,a,boat,tying,student,and,teacher,together,.,That,said,here,too,the,students,and,teacher,share,a,single,goal,to,play,well,.,The,coach,knows,how,to,instruct,their,players,to,do,so,and,by,succeeding,in,their,task,everyone,profits,.
This,is,a,fine,metaphor,.,There,is,work,and,agency,on,the,part,of,both,students,and,teachers,.,However,while,success,is,exactly,the,same,thing,for,every,member,of,a,team,winning,that,isnt,true,for,students,who,can,all,want,and,receive,different,things,from,the,same,teacher,.
A,coach,is,literally,a,type,of,teacher,.,That,is,by,definition,what,they,are,doing,.,So,this,metaphor,fits,perfecty,due,to,this,comparison,.
In,some,instances,this,may,be,true,but,for,the,most,part,I,think,students,are,more,like,sponges,that,are,taking,in,what,they,need,to,be,able,to,thrive,in,a,very,competitive,society,.,The,teaching,is,in,the,hands,of,the,teacher,and,they,need,to,get,their,students,excited,to,learn,.
That,is,the,perfect,analogy,.,Teachers,are,training,students,just,like,coaches,train,their,athletes,.
They,tell,students,what,to,do,.
A,professor,is,a,leader,for,knowledge,.,Coaches,are,usually,more,demanding,and,expecting,of,performance,that,professors,generally,are,.,Some,students,can,be,like,athletes,in,terms,of,them,competing,for,the,best,grades,in,the,class,.
The,coach,expects,his,athletes,to,work,hard,and,perform,well,when,it,counts,.,Its,a,constant,checking,up,system,.
Its,not,the,most,imaginative,metaphor,but,its,apt,.,The,teacher,has,gone,beyond,the,stage,in,his,or,her,life,when,she,would,be,an,athlete,or,student,and,is,now,passing,on,his,or,her,wisdom,and,guidance,to,the,next,generation,.
Because,both,a,teacher,and,a,coach,help,to,develop,skills,and,knowledge,but,physical,things,and,mental,intelligence,arent,exactly,the,same,.
I,dont,think,this,fits,because,students,can,pretty,much,leave,their,team,and,join,other,teams,freely,.
Coaches,by,their,nature,are,teachers,.,Instead,of,teaching,a,sporting,concept,.,Teachers,teach,students,other,concepts,so,this,metaphor,works,.
Students,are,responsible,for,their,own,learning,.,They,have,to,be,active,and,present,.,It,isnt,the,professors,job,to,necessarily,motivate,the,student,.,It,helps,if,he,or,she,is,enthusiastic,about,learning,.,Still,I,dont,really,like,this,metaphor,.
The,teacher,assigns,the,work,that,he,believes,will,teach,the,course,.,It,is,up,to,the,student,to,pass,.,An,athlete,does,not,need,to,pass,he,does,it,because,he,wants,to,be,competitive,.,Student,passes,to,get,the,degree,.
Somewhat,agree,in,the,sense,that,a,coach,provides,the,plan,of,attack,and,helps,athletes,focus,on,their,strengths,and,discard,bad,habits,in,pursuit,of,their,goal,.
This,metaphor,seems,too,broad,because,coaches,are,in,a,sense,teachers,in,teaching,the,sport,to,the,athletes,but,in,the,end,they,can,be,more,focused,on,winning,a,game,at,the,expense,of,some,of,the,players,.
The,teacher,is,the,person,who,guides,the,student,like,a,coach,on,a,sports,team,.,He,or,she,helps,them,develop,skills,to,be,a,success,.
Again,this,is,a,simile,not,a,metaphor,.,A,teacher,much,like,a,coach,is,an,encourager,a,guide,on,the,side,a,person,in,charge,a,leader,.,Students,are,like,athletes,in,that,they,listen,and,respond,to,the,coach,and,they,work,hard,.
That,is,true,teachers,are,like,coaches,and,the,students,are,like,athletes,because,the,teachers,is,teaching,them,on,how,to,do,good,work,and,succeed,.,Just,like,a,football,game,the,coach,is,teaching,his,players,on,how,to,win,and,succeed,.
I,think,this,is,true,.,A,coach,teaches,encourages,and,supports,athletes,as,they,progress,and,work,to,achieve,their,goals,.,Teachers,do,the,same,thing,for,students,and,it,is,an,ongoing,collaborative,relationship,that,results,in,achievement,if,done,properly,or,lack,of,success,if,no,work,and,effort,are,put,into,it,.
I,definitely,agree,here,because,with,this,metaphor,the,students,can,vary,in,ability,based,on,how,well,they,listen,to,the,coach,and,their,individual,motivation,and,athletic,ability,.
The,coach,guides,the,general,direction,of,the,team,but,in,a,classroom,theres,no,single,real,world,objective,like,there,is,on,a,team,.,Hopefully,the,teacher,or,coach,will,impart,some,knowledge,on,the,students,or,athletes,along,the,way,.
I,dont,believe,this,applies,unless,the,students,are,in,some,sort,of,academic,team,or,under,the,mentorship,of,a,professor,.,But,most,teachers,dont,meet,this,level,of,leadership,or,guidance,at,least,for,the,majority,of,their,students,.
A,coach,guides,athletes,just,a,teacher,guides,students,.
Very,much,.,Coaches,are,teachers,and,they,have,a,lot,of,authority,.,Students,must,do,what,the,teacher,says,and,not,everyone,makes,the,cut,.,Students,like,athletes,are,judged,by,performance,.
Teachers,are,going,out,their,way,to,try,and,teach,people,things,they,need,to,be,able,to,grow,into,being,adults,and,go,down,the,path,they,choose,.
I,like,this,analogy,.,Coaches,help,athletes,grow,and,learn,about,their,sport,just,like,a,teacher,helps,students,.
A,student,has,the,basic,information,and,can,find,the,information,anywhere,.,Knowing,how,to,apply,the,information,properly,is,an,art,.
A,college,teacher,is,like,a,coach,they,guide,students,to,success,.,They,are,unlike,a,coach,in,that,they,show,more,compassion,and,do,not,bench,people,for,poor,performance,.

I,think,a,teacher,can,be,like,a,coach,where,they,are,helping,them,and,telling,the,what,to,do,but,I,dont,think,they,are,much,like,a,coach,.
Decent,in,that,the,athletes,perform,the,work,and,the,teacher,gives,them,advice,and,guidance,.
A,coach,is,someone,who,motivates,his,team,.,You,can,think,of,your,classroom,as,a,team,and,the,teacher,is,motivating,you,.
This,doesnt,have,anything,to,do,with,learning,and,coaches,dont,really,teach,much,of,anything,they,just,train,the,athletes,.,I,dont,really,see,the,similarity,.
While,there,is,definitely,a,little,bit,of,truth,here,since,teachers,and,coaches,arent,completely,dissimilar,I,dont,agree,with,the,notion,that,the,class,is,necessarily,like,a,team,.,Not,everyone,works,together,necessarily,.,Classes,are,more,loose,than,that,and,students,arent,necessarily,working,towards,a,shared,goal,.,True,the,goal,is,the,same,but,that,doesnt,mean,its,a,shared,goal,.,Students,are,competing,against,one,another,largely,and,even,the,teacher,may,be,seen,as,an,antagonist,.
This,really,resonates,with,me,because,a,teacher,is,exactly,like,a,coach,academically,for,their,students,.
This,metaphor,makes,sense,because,like,a,coach,with,athletes,working,toward,winning,games,a,teacher,rallies,their,students,to,work,toward,goals,such,as,exams,and,projects,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,coach,and,students,are,like,athletes,because,the,teacher,is,pushing,the,students,to,new,heights,by,teaching,them,.
I,disagree,because,I,think,coaches,are,more,authoritative,than,a,teacher,.,Teachers,also,arent,as,close,to,their,students,as,coaches,are,with,their,team,.
A,teacher,shapes,us,and,gives,us,advice,and,knowledge,on,how,to,become,better,every,time,.,A,coach,is,the,same,way,they,want,the,best,for,us,.
This,is,a,great,metaphor,for,the,student,teacher,relationship,because,a,coach,is,responsible,for,instilling,and,developing,skills,as,well,as,motivating,young,athletes,much,like,the,teacher,is,responsible,for,instilling,the,required,skills,in,all,their,students,.
I,agree,with,this,metaphor,because,teachers,are,the,ones,who,guide,students,into,what,to,study,.,Teachers,are,the,ones,who,tell,students,what,to,study,so,they,can,improve,in,whatever,the,subject,is
Generally,speaking,coaches,are,there,to,plan,the,route,provide,guidance,and,help,steer,those,under,their,care,in,the,right,direction,.,The,students,or,athletes,are,responsible,for,the,physical,action,of,making,that,happen,.,In,other,words,its,on,them,to,put,in,the,effort,.
I,feel,this,is,something,that,makes,sense,and,you,can,actually,see,teachers,being,this,way,on,a,day,to,day,basis,.
Ill,go,along,with,this,one,.,Athletes,must,be,taught,the,rules,of,the,game,.,Athletes,must,be,taught,how,to,play,.,Athletes,must,be,taught,safety,.,Athletes,must,be,taught,gamesmanship,and,fair,play,.,Athletes,must,be,taught,everything,about,their,sport,from,the,ground,on,up,.,The,same,can,be,said,for,philosophy,economics,higher,mathematics,linguistics,physics,and,all,the,rest,.
Coaches,develop,talent,already,there,just,refining,it,.
