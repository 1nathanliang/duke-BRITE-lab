A,college,teacher,is,a,gardener,because,they,have,to,tend,to,the,plants,e.g,.,students,by,giving,them,knowledge,and,tools,for,success,for,the,plants,to,grow,or,students,to,gain,knowledge,.
An,effective,college,professor,can,stimulate,growth,in,his,students,.,In,this,metaphor,the,gardener,watering,the,flowers,represents,the,college,professor,teaching,the,students,.
To,me,this,means,that,the,teacher,is,doing,everything,they,can,to,help,their,students,be,successful,.,They,are,sowing,the,seeds,and,providing,water,and,sunlight,to,allow,their,plants,to,grow,and,flourish,.
Students,are,like,plants,because,we,are,still,growing,.,Our,teachers,are,our,gardeners,because,they,help,and,provide,us,the,right,tools,to,help,us,grow,.
I,am,pursuing,my,degree,in,Electronics,and,Communication,when,I,started,my,degree,I,had,to,learn,all,the,basic,in,first,year,.,I,just,chose,a,degree,to,learn,but,professor,are,the,ones,that,are,going,to,teach,me,from,the,basics,.,If,they,dont,make,it,interesting,to,learn,I,will,never,be,a,good,engineer,.,Basics,of,every,subject,are,very,important,to,learn,it,is,basically,like,giving,nutrients,and,water,to,plant,in,order,to,grow,.
This,relates,a,lot,to,how,I,described,teachers,.,Taking,care,of,plants,requires,thought,and,attention,and,just,pouring,any,random,amount,of,water,on,them,wont,automatically,make,them,grow,.
a,teacher,is,similar,to,a,gardener,because,they,put,time,into,the,students,they,water,them,they,feed,them,information,they,make,sure,they,grow,accordingly,.,and,the,students,only,job,is,to,take,in,the,information,and,to,use,it,to,grow,themselves,.
The,teacher,tends,to,the,students,and,grows,their,minds,to,become,more,knowledgeable,just,like,how,a,gardener,tends,to,plants,.
A,teacher,guides,and,pruned,the,student,to,gain,the,knowledge,they,need,to,succeed,just,as,a,gardener,prunes,and,helps,the,plant,along,until,it,blooms,.
I,disagree,with,this,one,.,What,comes,to,mind,initially,is,that,a,gardener,really,cares,about,and,has,to,take,care,of,their,plants,which,I,dont,think,translates,.,In,the,sense,that,they,help,students,grow,I,could,agree,.
Gardeners,help,plants,grow,in,a,physical,sense,.,Teachers,help,students,grow,in,an,intellectual,sense,.
A,college,teacher,can,be,like,a,gardener,and,students,like,plants,since,the,college,teacher,is,giving,the,students,knowledge,which,then,advances,within,the,students,via,their,careful,thought,just,like,a,gardener,plants,seeds,which,then,grow,into,plants,.
Teachers,plant,the,seed,and,its,up,to,the,students,to,figure,what,to,do,with,that,seed,.,Students,will,either,do,nothing,with,that,seed,or,they,will,plant,the,seed,and,allow,for,growth,of,information,.
A,college,teacher,will,take,the,time,possibly,3,hours,a,week,to,nurture,the,mind,and,develop,and,build,on,a,subject,the,student,is,trying,to,learn,.,Overtime,the,student,will,blossom,with,knowledge,just,like,a,flower,will,bloom,once,tended,to,over,time
Students,are,impressionable,and,looking,to,grow,.,Teachers,being,the,gardener,they,have,plenty,of,knowledge,that,they,are,able,to,impart,on,their,students,.,Similar,to,a,gardener,watering,their,plants,.
It,means,that,they,have,to,take,the,time,to,nurture,them,and,monitor,how,they,are,responding,to,their,environments,and,the,efforts,to,improve,them,.
I,think,this,is,pretty,true,.,Teachers,provide,the,knowledge,needed,to,help,students,flourish,and,grow,.
The,students,are,the,plants,for,they,are,growing,and,the,teacher,is,there,to,cater,for,them,as,the,gardener
The,teacher,is,helping,the,student,grow,and,become,knowledgeable,about,specific,information,.,They,are,shaping,the,students,and,hopefully,helping,them,become,someone,in,society,.
A,college,teacher,plants,the,seeds,and,provides,consistent,nourishment,for,plants,or,students,but,ultimately,on,some,level,the,plant,has,to,want,to,live,and,thrive,.
Teachers,tend,to,their,students,like,they,would,a,plant,to,watch,them,grow,and,thrive,into,productive,beings,.
A,teacher,makes,the,student,grow,and,mature,.,The,water,is,the,information,they,give,us,.,When,the,plant,gets,the,water,they,grow,up,.,They,get,bigger,and,more,sturdy,.,The,plant,growing,is,the,knowledge,we,are,obtaining,.
Teacher,can,be,like,a,gardener,as,they,nurture,and,aid,students,to,understand,a,concept,.,This,is,much,like,the,teacher,using,their,knowledge,to,fertilize,students,and,help,their,minds,grow,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,because,the,teacher,gives,the,students,knowledge,which,is,the,water,and,sunlight,to,allow,the,student,to,bloom,.
I,think,college,teachers,can,heavily,influence,a,student,similar,to,some,plants,that,need,extra,care,.,But,if,students,are,like,plants,we,can,also,subdivide,these,students,further,with,some,students,being,succulents,and,some,being,roses,.
A,teacher,must,tend,to,each,different,student,differently,depending,on,their,individual,needs,feed,them,knowledge,guide,their,growth,+,support,them,through,any,weaknesses,.,That,is,how,a,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,+,students,are,like,plants,.
This,is,because,the,teacher,waters,the,students,with,information,and,carefully,natures,them,so,they,grow,up,to,be,successful,people,.
A,teacher,is,responsible,for,helping,the,students,to,grow,by,providing,them,with,academic,nourishment,and,tending,to,them,.
They,tend,to,you,with,knowledge,.,You,grow,as,a,person,by,learning,from,them,.,Depending,on,the,class,it,can,be,super,relative,or,not,.
the,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,because,they,are,watering,the,students,plants,with,knowledge,.,As,long,as,the,teacher,gardener,keeps,watering,the,students,plants,the,students,will,grow,and,nourish,.
A,gardener,plants,seeds,and,nurtures,them,.,A,teacher,gives,students,information,and,knowledge,that,they,could,use,to,improve,themselves,.,Students,take,that,information,and,may,improve,or,fail,depending,on,circumstances,.
typically,students,have,inherent,potential,that,a,good,teacher,will,help,them,to,realize,and,fulfill,.
The,teacher,is,a,gardener,in,the,sense,that,they,are,planting,seeds,of,knowledge,into,their,students,.,The,students,are,the,plants,that,thrive,and,grow,from,those,seeds,.
A,college,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,by,the,fact,a,gardener,raises,plants,.,If,raised,correctly,the,students,or,plants,can,grow,to,be,strong,and,successful,.
This,is,a,great,metaphor,because,it,is,very,much,like,how,college,actually,is,.,The,teacher,is,the,gardener,who,plants,the,seeds,takes,care,of,the,students,plants,and,helps,them,to,grow,over,the,years,.
A,teacher,provides,nutrients,aka,learning,material,to,the,student,which,is,the,budding,plant,.,Without,the,teacher,the,students,would,not,grow,up,into,the,mature,successful,plant,person,that,they,are,.
The,gardener,tends,to,its,plants,to,feed,them,and,help,them,grow,just,like,professors,give,students,the,tools,to,gain,knowledge
This,metaphor,visualizes,the,college,teacher,as,a,gardener,who,nurtures,the,students,who,are,plants,that,are,in,their,early,stages,of,growing,.,The,students,rely,on,the,gardener,that,will,help,nurture,the,plants,growth,in,order,to,bear,fruit,.
Just,like,how,a,gardener,takes,care,of,a,plant,can,affect,the,growth,of,that,plant,teacher,is,very,crucial,to,how,a,student,can,learn,and,grow,.,I,think,that,a,great,college,teacher,can,nourish,the,students,with,their,own,knowledge,and,pass,on,the,skills,they,have,effectively,.

The,teacher,is,someone,who,guides,the,students,hence,helping,them,grow,.,In,a,way,a,teacher,is,like,a,gardener,who,is,planting,seeds,to,grow,into,something,and,the,ones,growing,are,the,students,.

A,teacher,can,be,similar,to,a,gardener,because,the,themes,and,ideas,that,they,are,planting,into,the,minds,of,their,students,can,cultivate,into,flourishing,careers,or,expanded,ideas,later
Plants,will,grow,as,fast,or,as,slow,as,big,or,as,small,as,the,gardeners,care,permits,.,Similarly,students,grow,in,knowledge,and,understanding,based,on,the,aptitude,and,skill,of,their,teacher,.
A,teacher,similar,to,a,gardener,helps,their,students,the,plants,grow,into,knowledgeable,people,.,I,dont,have,at,least,100,characters,to,decipher,this,metaphor
