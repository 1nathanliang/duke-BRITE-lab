The,teacher,is,molding,the,students,at,least,their,minds,to,be,sure,that,they,know,all,the,things,theyre,supposed,to,as,they,grow,up,.
The,teacher,is,attempting,to,mold,the,students,into,the,correct,forms,that,the,teacher,wants,them,to,be,.,The,teacher,wants,to,turn,the,students,into,masterpieces,metaphorically,in,reality,meaning,masters,of,whatever,is,being,taught,in,the,class,.
The,teacher,can,make,the,students,out,to,be,whatever,way,they,like,depending,on,the,information,they,fed,the,students,.
This,means,that,students,are,basically,nothing,until,the,teachers,teaches,them,.,They,can,never,succeed,in,their,life,until,they,learn,materials,about,life,from,teachers,.
The,teacher,is,the,one,who,has,all,the,knowledge,.,The,teacher,sculpts,that,knowledge,into,the,students,forming,a,statue,of,knowledge,or,another,potential,sculptor,.
Because,one,doesnt,exist,without,the,other,the,teacher,needs,the,student,as,much,as,the,student,needs,the,teacher
I,fell,like,this,metaphor,is,only,true,if,the,teacher,is,active,in,the,students,learning,.,I,had,a,lot,of,teachers,who,were,more,passive,and,I,basically,learned,from,a,textbook,.
Students,come,into,school,with,a,mind,that,is,melded,by,the,teacher,.,The,teacher,is,responsible,for,building,a,foundation,of,knowledge,for,the,students,to,take,with,them,.
A,teacher,has,the,ability,and,the,students,have,the,adaptability,.,Therefore,the,teacher,can,mould,students,knowledge,though,this,.
I,think,college,teachers,help,form,the,minds,of,students,.,They,take,clay,and,turn,it,into,something,wonderful,.
College,teacher,shapes,and,molds,how,a,student,learns,or,how,they,perceive,certain,things,or,how,they,go,about,solving,a,problem,.
Clay,like,students,has,the,potential,to,be,something,great,and,new,but,it,takes,a,sculptor,or,teacher,to,uncover,it,.
The,college,teacher,knows,how,to,make,something,basic,into,something,great,.,The,students,being,clay,show,how,they,can,be,molded,into,something,great,with,the,right,work,done,.
who,is,a,teacher,uses,his,knowledge,and,experience,to,sculpt,new,students,even,inexperienced,and,without,form
Teachers,are,responsible,for,essentially,molding,students,into,professionals,.,The,wrong,teacher,can,change,the,course,of,a,students,academic,career,.,Similarly,a,good,teacher,can,help,take,a,student,above,and,beyond,.
A,students,open,mind,is,the,clay,and,it,is,up,to,the,sculptor,teacher,to,be,able,to,use,that,open,mind,to,sculpt,them,into,perfect,students,using,the,knowledge,theyve,gained,.
A,college,teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,because,they,are,attempted,to,transform,and,mold,the,clay,students,into,a,better,shape,.,The,students,are,being,transformed,via,the,information,they,are,being,taught,.
Students,dont,yet,have,the,knowledge,that,they,need,in,the,subject,and,it,is,up,to,the,teacher,to,guide,the,students,learning,just,like,a,sculptor,will,use,their,hands,to,guide,the,way,the,clay,is,shaped,.
It,means,the,teacher,has,the,ability,to,structure,the,student,to,determine,what,the,student,learns,and,the,way,they,learn,and,what,they,learn,.
A,college,teacher,can,shape,the,way,their,students,think,.,A,bad,teacher,wont,be,able,to,make,much,of,a,difference,in,a,student,like,a,bad,sculptor,wont,get,good,results,but,a,good,teacher,can,completely,transform,their,students,.
To,me,this,metaphor,means,that,teachers,and,professors,or,those,in,instructional,roles,who,assist,students,use,their,knowledge,and,their,skills,in,professing,that,knowledge,to,mold,or,influence,the,development,of,their,students,.
Teachers,affect,or,shape,or,mold,their,students,like,clay,.,If,a,teacher,has,an,effective,teaching,style,then,the,students,will,learn,the,material,.,If,the,teacher,is,poor,in,their,style,then,students,will,not,be,shaped,to,be,intellectually,challenged,.
Teachers,mold,their,students,by,teaching,and,conveying,information,that,enables,them,to,become,their,own,people,.
This,is,most,definitely,an,accurate,metaphor,for,describing,a,teacher,and,their,students,.,This,is,because,the,students,are,there,to,learn,so,they,can,become,something,great,and,the,teach,is,the,one,who,will,guide,them,with,their,words,of,wisdom,and,personal,advice,.,This,is,similar,to,an,artist,who,moves,clay,with,his,hands,o,create,a,masterful,art,piece,.
Its,like,the,teacher,is,molding,the,students,into,thier,future,seems,by,giving,then,the,knowledge,and,taxiing,then,how,to,think
I,dont,totally,agree,.,Most,college,professors,facilitate,learning,so,they,arent,doing,so,much,sculpting,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,because,the,teacher,shapes,the,minds,and,worldviews,of,the,students,.,The,teacher,can,influence,how,people,think,for,the,rest,of,their,lives,thus,affecting,what,kind,of,people,their,students,will,become,.
A,teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,because,the,teacher,is,the,one,that,handles,and,gives,out,the,information,that,is,given,to,the,students,and,the,students,are,clay,because,they,can,be,changed,and,moved,with,the,information,and,opinions,that,they,hear,from,the,teacher,.
The,teacher,has,all,the,control,in,our,college,careers,.,Based,on,how,engaged,they,are,at,teaching,us,they,can,either,make,us,excited,about,something,or,dread,coming,to,their,class,.,As,a,result,our,academic,college,experience,is,based,on,how,well,we,were,taught,by,the,teacher,and,we,are,the,products,of,their,teaching,skills,.
I,think,that,in,this,instance,it,means,that,the,teacher,is,the,one,holding,all,the,power,to,mold,students,in,any,way,that,they,choose,.
The,teachers,are,who,makes,the,students,.,Theyre,the,one,that,gives,them,the,right,knowledge,to,succeed,in,their,careers,.
teacher,sculptor,convert,students,clay,into,a,beautiful,sculpture,knowledgeable,and,successful,.,Without,teacher,sculptor,clay,student,is,useless,.
Students,come,to,class,ready,to,learn,and,have,their,thoughts,molded,by,those,who,teach,them,.,Teachers,shape,a,students,thoughts,.
The,college,teacher,is,giving,information,to,their,students,therefore,they,are,molding,them,to,be,able,to,understand,the,material,.,They,shape,a,students,mind,so,they,can,learn,the,key,principals,of,the,subject
A,teacher,can,shape,the,way,that,students,are,able,to,look,at,different,things,from,both,in,academic,and,non,academic,matters
It,is,a,teachers,job,to,sculpt,the,students,into,the,best,version,of,themselves,.,Students,are,malleable,and,very,impressionable,this,puts,a,lot,of,responsibility,on,the,teacher,to,teach,them,the,right,way
A,teacher,can,sculpt,a,students,mind,to,think,a,certain,way,or,understand,things,.,To,create,an,image,if,you,will
A,teacher,molds,students,minds,.,He,or,she,is,the,one,who,takes,an,active,role,in,helping,students,absorb,new,information,and,students,are,more,passive,.
For,a,teacher,a,student,is,a,lot,like,clay,for,the,sculptor,.,Their,minds,are,their,medium,of,choice,and,they,are,able,to,form,them,and,mold,them,into,informed,minds,.

The,teacher,can,mold,the,students,into,what,they,think,they,should,be,using,their,teaching,methods,or,other,tools,.
Especially,in,certain,aspects,of,a,class,a,student,does,not,have,a,lot,of,knowledge,of,a,subject,.,A,college,teacher,has,the,ability,to,give,them,knowledge,and,shape,how,the,student,use,that,knowledge,.
The,way,a,teacher,teaches,their,student,will,forever,affect,their,life,and,thought,process,.,The,way,we,are,taught,shapes,the,future,of,how,we,learn,.
A,college,teacher,can,be,like,a,sculptor,in,that,they,can,educate,a,student,on,many,things,thereby,molding,their,minds,into,something,better,.,The,students,are,like,clay,in,that,their,minds,are,simply,waiting,for,a,talented,sculptor,ie,a,teacher,to,mold,them,into,something,beautiful,.
students,are,willing,to,learn,and,the,teachers,have,to,teach,them,what,is,right,.,students,come,into,school,not,knowing,what,they,need,to,know,and,the,teachers,have,to,guide,them,and,shape,them,.
It,is,noted,that,teachers,are,like,carpenters,and,he,is,made,potter,of,pottery,students,are,mentioned,that,clay,is,therefore,a,major,contributor,to,the,development,of,students
A,college,teacher,could,be,a,sculptor,to,their,students,who,are,like,clay,because,they,can,help,influence,their,beliefs,and,thoughts,.,They,can,have,a,great,impact,in,their,future,as,they,can,motivate,a,student,to,go,into,their,same,career,or,they,can,make,a,student,deviate,completely,if,they,hated,their,class,.
Our,teachers,mold,us,into,what,we,need,to,become,in,order,to,be,a,beautiful,masterpiece,.,I,really,like,this,metaphor,because,it,also,shows,the,importance,of,being,able,to,allow,your,teacher,to,mold,you,or,help,you,as,their,student,so,that,you,can,succeed,.,Just,like,a,sculptor,is,experienced,in,making,art,pieces,with,clay,so,our,teachers,are,also,experts,in,teaching,us,to,the,best,of,their,ability,.
they,help,form,the,future,and,can,make,a,boring,student,into,a,genius,with,their,teaching,skills,and,love
Teachers,mold,students,into,better,students,are,mold,them,to,be,successful,in,whatever,they,are,studying,.

A,college,teacher,takes,our,minds,and,shapes,them,into,what,we,are,today,.,They,do,this,by,making,us,think,outside,the,box,and,sculpting,the,way,we,live,.
In,a,way,through,teaching,professors,are,consistently,molding,their,students,thoughts,and,ideas,.,They,are,forming,their,students,to,become,better,versions,of,themselves,.
I,like,this,one,because,the,teachers,shape,the,students,minds,.,But,its,kind,of,manipulative,at,the,same,time,.
To,me,this,means,that,the,teacher,helps,mold,the,students,into,the,people,they,are,meant,to,become,.
Students,are,blank,slates,in,the,sense,that,they,have,so,little,knowledge,and,it,is,the,teachers,responsibilities,to,shape,their,minds,through,knowledge
The,teacher,is,sculpting,students,to,be,better,smarter,more,educated,people,.,Turning,them,into,something,better,.
This,implies,that,students,are,formless,until,given,to,a,teacher,to,mold,but,this,precludes,any,notion,of,the,students,individuality,or,personal,experience,and,is,a,subtly,toxic,notion,to,perpetuate,given,that,the,teachers,role,is,to,guide,development,not,create,it,like,a,god,.
I,believe,that,some,can,absolutely,shape,your,future,and,mold,you,.,I,had,a,professor,for,several,classes,who,did,this,for,me,.,She,showed,me,many,skills,that,have,helped,advance,my,career,and,she,has,continued,to,mentor,me,after,her,classes,have,concluded,.
In,a,way,teachers,mold,students,minds,in,the,same,way,that,a,sculptor,molds,a,sculpture,.,Teachers,give,students,the,information,they,want,them,to,have,and,also,teach,them,how,to,use,or,apply,that,information,.
I,think,this,means,that,students,minds,are,unshaped,and,ready,to,be,changed,with,information,and,new,ideas,and,ways,of,thinking,their,minds,are,essentially,blank,slates,.,Teachers,are,like,sculptors,because,they,have,the,skills,and,experience,to,shape,students,minds,from,a,blank,slate,to,something,filled,with,knowledge,and,ideas,.
Teachers,are,there,to,teach,students,to,mold,them,and,show,them,how,to,do,new,things,They,are,basically,sculpting,the,minds,and,turn,them,into,something,brilliant,.
The,teacher,provides,you,with,information,that,shapes,the,way,you,see,the,world,and,behave,.,The,minds,of,the,students,are,influenced,by,the,teacher,which,makes,them,moldable,.
Teachers,are,like,mentors,shaping,the,minds,of,students,and,inspiring,them,.,They,are,supposed,to,be,the,educators,that,make,sure,lessons,stick,in,the,students,mind,.
Students,are,a,blank,canvas,and,the,professors,job,is,to,develop,or,mold,that,canvas,their,students,.,I,believe,that,the,way,a,professor,can,reach,their,students,and,successfully,teach,them,the,material,is,highly,dependent,on,their,artistic,or,teaching,abilities
It,actually,makes,plentiful,sense,.,The,teacher,is,like,a,sculptor,whereas,the,students,are,clay,meaning,that,hes,making,them,into,a,creation,by,teaching,them,lessons,that,will,help,them,for,the,long,run,.
Teachers,are,the,people,who,mold,their,students,brain,and,help,them,learn,.,Without,teachers,students,would,struggle,because,theyd,have,to,learn,without,a,form,of,reference,other,than,each,other,who,may,not,know,enough
A,sculptor,tries,to,take,each,piece,of,clay,and,forms,it,into,the,best,possible,result,it,can,be,much,like,a,teacher,tries,to,teach,their,students,the,best,they,can,.
a,teacher,molds,a,student,into,a,decent,member,of,the,profession,they,want,to,be,apart,of,a,better,member,of,society
I,think,that,what,teachers,do,say,and,teach,all,effect,the,student,.,The,student,learns,from,the,teacher,.,There,are,many,different,approaches,to,teaching,and,each,thing,a,teacher,does,shapes,the,type,of,student,and,person,their,students,become,.
