0,A2REPYH8YFUNJ2,1,College teachers are after tenure for the most part although most will not admit it. I've met several college teachers that outright should not be teaching in a college setting. They get irritated with students asking questions. Some of them just read from a book which in essence means students are paying to have someone read a book to them in class rather than provide insight and guided instruction. There is some good professors but those are usually the ones that somehow manage to not get tenured or find out that teaching isn't worth it when you consider all of the administrative things they have to deal with.,4,4,NA,"I actually really like the metaphor.
